* PART I.--INTRODUCTORY,

第一部分——导论

(1)THE most obvious mechanical phenomenon in electrical and magnetical experiments is the mutual action by which bodies in certain states set each other in motion while still at a sensible distance from each other. The first step, therefore, in reducing these phenomena into scientific form, is to ascertain the magnitude and direction of the force acting between the bodies, and when it is found that this force depends in a certain way upon the relative position of the bodies and on their electric or magnetic condition, it seems at first sight natural to explain the facts by assuming the existence of some- thing either at rest orin motion in each body, constituting its electric or magnetic state, and capable of acting at a distance according to mathematical laws.

（1） 在电学和磁学实验中，最明显的机械现象是相互作用，通过这种相互作用，处于某些状态的物体在彼此保持合理距离的情况下使彼此运动。因此，将这些现象简化为科学形式的第一步是确定作用在物体之间的力的大小和方向，当发现这种力在某种程度上取决于物体的相对位置及其电或磁条件时，乍一看，通过假设存在某种东西来解释事实是很自然的，这种东西在每个物体中要么静止，要么运动，构成其电态或磁态，并且能够根据数学定律在一定距离内起作用。

In this way mathematical theories of statical electricity, of magnetism, of the mecha- nical action between conductors carrying currents, and of the induction of currents have been formed. In these theories the force acting between the two bodies is treated with reference only to the condition of the bodies and their relative position, and without any express consideration of the surrounding medium.

These theories assume, more or less explicitly, the existence of substances the parti- cles of which have the property of acting on one another at a distance byattraction or repulsion. The most complete development of a theory of this kind is that of M. W. WEBER*, who has made the same theory include electrostatic and electromagnetic phenomena.

通过这种方式，形成了静电、磁性、载流导体之间的机械作用和电流感应的数学理论。在这些理论中，作用在两个物体之间的力只参考物体的条件和它们的相对位置来处理，而没有任何明确的考虑周围介质。
这些理论或多或少明确地假设存在物质，其部分具有通过吸引或排斥在一定距离内相互作用的性质。这类理论最完整的发展是M.W.WEBER*的理论，他提出了同样的理论，包括静电和电磁现象。

In doing so, however, he has found it necessary to assume that the force between two electric particles depends on their relative velocity, as well as on their distance.

This theory, as developed by MM. W. WEBE and C. NEUMANN, is exceedingly ingenious, and wonderfully comprehensive in its application to the phenomena of statical electricity, electromagnetic attractions, induction of currents and diamagnetic phenomena; and it comes to us with the more authority, as it has served to guide the speculations of one who has made so great an advance in the practical part of electric science, both by introducing a consistent system of units in electrical measurement, and by actually determining electrical quantities with an accuracy hitherto unknown.

然而，在这样做的过程中，他发现有必要假设两个电粒子之间的力取决于它们的相对速度和距离。

这一理论是由M.W.WEBE和C.NEUMANN发展起来的十, 在应用于静电、电磁引力、电流感应和反磁现象方面，它是非常巧妙和全面的；它给我们带来了更大的权威，因为它通过在电学测量中引入一致的单位制，以及以迄今为止未知的精度实际确定电量，指导了一位在电学实用领域取得巨大进步的人的推测。

(2) The mechanical difficulties, however, which are involved in the assumption of particles acting at a distance with forces which depend on their velocities are such as to prevent me from considering this theory as an ultimate one, though it may have been, and may yet be useful in leading to the coordination of phenomena.

I have therefore preferred to seek an explanation of the fact in another direction, by supposing them to be produced by actions which go on in the surrounding medium as well as in the excited bodies, and endeavouring to explain the action between distant bodies without assuming the existence of forces capable of acting directly at sensible distances.

（2） 然而，假设粒子以取决于其速度的力在一定距离上作用，所涉及的机械困难使我无法将这一理论视为最终理论，尽管它可能已经是，而且可能在导致现象协调方面有用。

因此，我倾向于从另一个方向寻求对这一事实的解释，假设它们是由周围介质和受激物体中发生的作用产生的，并努力解释遥远物体之间的作用，而不假设存在能够直接作用于合理距离的力。

(3) The theory I propose may therefore be called a theory of the Electromagnetic Field, because it has to do with the space in the neighbourhood of the electric or magnetic bodies, and it may be called a Dynamical Theory, because it assumes that in that space there is matter in motion, by which the observed electromagnetic phenomena are produced.

（3） 因此，我提出的理论可以被称为电磁场理论，因为它与电体或磁性体附近的空间有关，它可以被称之为动力学理论，因为其假设在该空间中存在运动中的物质，从而产生观察到的电磁现象。

(4) The electromagnetic field is that part of space which contains and surrounds bodies in electric or magnetic conditions.

It may be filled with any kind of matter, or we may endeavour to render it empty of all gross matter, as in the case of GEISSLER's tubes and other so-called vacua.

There is always, however, enough of matter left to receive and transmit the undulations of light and heat, and it is because the transmission of these radiations is not greatly altered when transparent bodies of measurable density are substituted for the so-called vacuum, that we are obliged to admit that the undulations are those of an ethereal substance, and not of the gross matter, the presence of which merely modifies in some way the motion of the aether.

We have therefore some reason to believe, from the phenomena of light and heat, that there is an aethereal medium filling space and permeating bodies, capable of being set in motion and of transmitting that motion from one part to another, and of communicating that motion to gross matter so as to heat it and affect it in various ways.

（4） 电磁场是在电或磁条件下包含并围绕物体的空间部分。
它可能充满了任何种类的物质，或者我们可能会努力使它没有所有的总物质，就像GEISSLER的管子和其他所谓的真空吸尘器一样。
然而，总有足够的物质来接收和传输光和热的波动，正是因为当具有可测量密度的透明体取代所谓的真空时，这些辐射的传输不会发生很大变化，所以我们不得不承认，这些波动是空灵物质的波动，而不是总物质的波动，它的存在只是在某种程度上改变了以太的动作。
因此，我们有理由相信，从光和热的现象来看，存在一种充满空间和渗透体的以太介质，它能够运动，并将运动从一个部分传递到另一个部分，并将这种运动传递给总物质，从而以各种方式加热和影响它。

(5) Now the energy communicated to the body in heating it must have formerly existed in the moving medium, for the undulations had left the source of heat some time before they reached the body, and during that time the energy must have been half in the form of motion of the medium and half in the form of elastic resilience. From these considerations Professor W. THOMSON has argued, that the medium must have a density capable of comparison with that of gross matter, and has even assigned an inferior limit to that density.

(6) We may therefore receive, as a datum derived from a branch of science independent of that with which we have to deal, the existence of a pervading medium, of small but real density, capable of being set in motion, and of transmitting motion from one part to another with great, but not infinite, velocity.

（5） 现在，在加热过程中传递给身体的能量必须以前存在于运动介质中，因为波动在到达身体之前的一段时间已经离开了热源，在这段时间内，能量必须有一半是介质运动的形式，一半是弹性回弹力的形式。根据这些考虑，汤姆森教授认为，介质的密度必须能够与总物质的密度相比较，甚至为该密度指定了一个内部极限。

（6） 因此，我们可以从一个独立于我们必须处理的科学分支中得到一个数据，即一种渗透介质的存在，这种介质的密度很小但很真实，能够运动，并能够以很大但不是无限的速度将运动从一个部分传递到另一个部分。

Hence the parts of this medium must be so connected that the motion of one part depends in some way on the motion of the rest; and at the same time these connexions must be capable of a certain kind of elastic yielding, since the communication of motion is not instantaneous, but occupies time.

因此，这种介质的各部分必须如此连接，使得一部分的运动在某种程度上取决于其余部分的运动；同时，这些连接必须能够产生某种弹性屈服，因为运动的传递不是瞬间的，而是占用时间的。

The medium is therefore capable of receiving and storing up two kinds of energy, namely, the “actual" energy depending on the motions of its parts, and “ potential" energy, consisting of the work which the medium will do in recovering from displace- ment in virtue of its elasticity.

The propagation of undulations consists in the continual transformation of one of these forms of energy into the other alternately, and at any instant the amount of energy in the whole medium is equally divided, so that half is energy of motion, and half is elastic resilience.

因此，介质能够接收和储存两种能量，即取决于其部件运动的“实际”能量和“势能”，后者由介质在利用其弹性从位移中恢复时所做的功组成。

波动的传播包括将其中一种形式的能量交替地连续转换为另一种形式，在任何时刻，整个介质中的能量都是相等的，因此一半是运动能量，一半是弹性回弹。

(7)A medium having such a constitution may be capable of other kinds of motion and displacement than those which produce the phenomena of light and heat, and some of these may be of such a kind that they may be evidenced to our senses by the phenomena they produce.

（7） 具有这种结构的介质可能能够进行其他类型的运动和位移代替产生光和热现象的介质，其中一些类型的现象可以通过我们的感官感知。

(8) Now we know that the luminiferous medium is in certain cases acted on by magnetism; for FARADAY discovered that when a plane polarized ray traverses a trans- parent diamagnetic medium in the direction of the lines of magnetic force produced by magnets or currents in the neighbourhood, the plane of polarization is caused to rotate.

（8） 现在我们知道，在某些情况下，发光介质受到磁性的作用；法拉弟第发现，当平面偏振射线沿附近磁体或电流产生的磁力线方向穿过反母体反磁性介质时，偏振平面会旋转。

This rotation is always in the direction in which positive electricity must be carried round the diamagnetic body in order to produce the actual magnetization of the field.

M.VERDET has since discovered that if a paramagnetic body, such as solution of perchloride of iron in ether, be substituted for the diamagnetic body, the rotation is in the opposite direction.

这种旋转总是在反磁性体周围必须携带正电的方向上，以便产生场的实际磁化。

M.VERDET后来发现，如果用顺磁性体，如铁的高氯酸盐在乙醚中的溶液，代替反磁性体，则旋转方向相反。

Now Professor W. THOMSON has pointed out that no distribution of forces acting between the parts of a medium whose only motion is that of the luminous vibrations, is sufficient to account for the phenomena, but that we must admit the existence of a motion in the medium depending on the magnetization, in addition to the vibratory motion which constitutes light.

现在，W·汤姆森教授指出，作用在介质各部分之间的力的分布，其唯一的运动是发光振动，不足以解释这些现象，但我们必须承认，除了构成光的振动运动外，介质中还存在取决于磁化强度的运动。

It is true that the rotation by magnetism of the plane of polarization has been observed only in media of considerable density; but the properties of the magnetic field are not so much altered by the substitution of one medium for another, or for a vacuum, as to allow us to suppose that the dense medium does anything more than merely modify the motion of the ether. We have therefore warrantable grounds for inquiring whether there may not be a motion of the ethereal medium going on wherever magnetic effects are observed, and we have some reason to suppose that this motion is one of rotation, having the direction of the magnetic force as its axis.

的确，只有在密度相当大的介质中才能观察到极化平面的磁性旋转；但是，磁场的性质并没有因为一种介质取代另一种介质或真空而发生太大变化，因此我们可以假设致密介质不仅仅改变了以太的运动。因此，我们有充分的理由来探究，在任何观察到磁效应的地方，以太介质是否可能没有运动，我们有理由假设这种运动是一种旋转，以磁力的方向为轴。

9)We may now consider another phenomenon observed in the electromagnetic field. When a body is moved across the lines of magnetic force it experiences what is called an electromotive force; the two extremities of the body tend to become oppositely electrified, and an electric current tends to flow through the body. When the electromotive force is sufficiently powerful, and is made to act on certain compound bodies, it decomposes them, and causes one of their components to pass towards one extremity of the body, and the other in the opposite direction.

9）我们现在可以考虑在电磁场中观察到的另一种现象。当物体在磁力线上移动时，它会经历所谓的电动势；物体的两端往往会反向通电，电流往往会流过物体。当电动势足够强大，并作用在某些复合物体上时，它会分解它们，并使它们的一个成分朝着物体的一端传递，另一个朝着相反的方向传递。

Here we have evidence of a force causing an electric current in spite of resistance; electrifying the extremities of a body in opposite ways, a condition which is sustained only by the action of the electromotive force, and which, as soon as that force is removed, tends, with an equal and opposite force, to produce a counter current through the body and to restore the original electrical state of the body; and finally, if strong enough, tearing to pieces chemical compounds and carrying their components in oppo- site directions, while their natural tendency is to combine, and to combine with a force which can generate an electromotive force in the reverse direction.

在这里，我们有证据表明，尽管有阻力，但力会产生电流；以相反的方式给物体的末端通电，这种情况只能通过电动势的作用来维持，并且一旦电动势被消除，就会以相等和相反的力在物体中产生反向电流，并恢复物体的原始电状态；最后，如果足够强大，将化学化合物撕成碎片，并将其成分向相反的方向携带，而它们的自然趋势是结合，并与一个能在相反方向产生电动势的力结合。

This, then, is a force acting on a body caused by its motion through the electromagnetic field, or by changes occurring in that field itself; and the effect of the force is either to produce a current and heat the body, or to decompose the body, or, when it can do neither, to put the body in a state of electric polarization,a state of constraint in which opposite extremities are oppositely electrified, and from which the body tends to relieve itself as soon as the disturbing force is removed.

因此，这是一种作用在物体上的力，由物体在电磁场中的运动或电磁场本身发生的变化引起；力的作用是产生电流并加热物体，或者分解物体，或者，当两者都不能做到时，使物体处于电极化状态，一种约束状态，在这种状态下，两端相反地通电，一旦干扰力消除，物体就会自行缓解。

(10)According to the theory which I propose to explain, this "electromotive force" is the force called into play during the communication of motion from one part of the medium to another, and it is by means of this force that the motion of one part causes motion in another part. When electromotive force acts on a conducting circuit, it produces a current, which, as it meets with resistance, occasions a continual transformation of electrical energy into heat, which is incapable of being restored again to the form of electrical energy by any reversal of the process.

（10） 根据我建议解释的理论，这个“电动势”是在运动从介质的一部分传递到另一部分的过程中产生的力，正是通过这个力，一部分的运动导致另一部分运动。当电动势作用在导电电路上时，它会产生电流，当它遇到电阻时，电流会导致电能不断转化为热量，而热量无法通过过程的任何逆转再次恢复为电能的形式。

(11) But when electromotive force acts on a dielectric it produces a state of polarization of its parts similar in distribution to the polarity of the parts of a mass of iron under the influence of a magnet, and like the magnetic polarization, capable of being described as a state in which every particle has its opposite poles in opposite conditions.

（11） 但是，当电动势作用在电介质上时，它会产生其部分的极化状态，其分布类似于磁铁影响下铁部分的极性，就像磁极化一样，能够被描述为每个粒子在相反条件下都有相反极性的状态。

In a dielectric under the action of electromotive force, we may conceive that the electricity in each molecule is so displaced that one side is rendered positively and the other negatively electrical, but that the electricity remains entirely connected with the molecule, and does not pass from one molecule to another. The effect of this action on the whole dielectric mass is to produce a general displacement of electricity in a certain direction. This displacement does not amount to a current, because when it has attained to a certain value it remains constant, but it is the commencement of a current, and its variations constitute currents in the positive or the negative direction according as the displacement is increasing or decreasing. In the interior of the dielectric there is no indication of electrification, because the electrification of the surface of any molecule is neutralized by the opposite electrification of the surface of the molecules in contact with it; but at the bounding surface of the dielectric, where the electrification is not neutralized, we find the phenomena which indicate positive or negative electrification.

在电介质中，在电动势的作用下，我们可以想象，每个分子中的电是如此移位，以至于一侧变成正电，另一侧变成负电，但电仍然与分子完全连接，不会从一个分子传递到另一个分子。这种作用对整个介电质的影响是在某个方向上产生电的一般位移。这种位移不等于电流，因为当它达到某个值时，它保持不变，但它是电流的开始，并且随着位移的增加或减少，它的变化构成正方向或负方向的电流。在电介质的内部没有带电的迹象，因为任何分子表面的带电被与其接触的分子表面的相反带电所中和；但在电介质的边界表面，带电没有被中和，我们发现了指示正带电或负带电的现象。

The relation between the electromotive force and the amount of electric displacement it produces depends on the nature of the dielectric, the same electromotive force producing generally a greater electric displacement in solid dielectrics, such as glass or sulphur, than in air.

电动势与其产生的电位移量之间的关系取决于电介质的性质，相同的电动势在固体电介质（如玻璃或硫）中通常比在空气中产生更大的电位移。

(11)Here, then, we perceive another effect of electromotive force, namely, electric displacement, which according to our theory is a kind of elastic yielding to the action of the force, similar to that which takes place in structures and machines owing to the want of perfect rigidity of the connexions.

（12） 因此，在这里，我们感知到电动势的另一种影响，即电位移，根据我们的理论，它是一种对力的作用的弹性屈服，类似于由于连接件缺乏完美的刚性而在结构和机器中发生的屈服。

(13) The practical investigation of the inductive capacity of dielectrics is rendered difficult on account of two disturbing phenomena. The first is the conductivity of the dielectric, which, though in many cases exceedingly small, is not altogether insensible. The second is the phenomenon called electric absorption, in virtue of which, when the dielectric is exposed to electromotive force, the electric displacement gradually increases, and when the electromotive force is removed, the dielectric does not instantly return to its primitive state, but only discharges a portion of its ectrification, and when left to itself gradually acquires electrification on its surface, as the interior gradually becomes depolarized. Almost all solid dielectrics exhibit this phenomenon, which gives rise to the residual charge in the Leyden jar, and to several phenomena of electric cables described by Mr. F. JENKIN.

（13） 由于两种干扰现象，电介质电感容量的实际研究变得困难。首先是电介质的导电性，尽管在许多情况下非常小，但并非完全不敏感。第二种是被称为电吸收的现象，由于这种现象，当电介质暴露于电动势时，电位移逐渐增加，当电动势被去除时，电介质不会立即恢复到其原始状态，而是只释放其电的一部分，当其内部逐渐去极化时，其表面逐渐带电。几乎所有固体电介质都表现出这种现象，这导致了Leyden罐中的残余电荷，以及F.JENKIN先生描述的电缆的几种现象。

(14) We have here two other kinds of yielding besides the yielding of the perfect dielectric, which we have compared to a perfectly elastic body. The yielding due to conductivity may be compared to that of a viscous fluid (that is to say, a fluid having great internal friction), or a soft solid on which the smallest force produces a permanent alteration of figure increasing with the time during which the force acts. The yielding due to electric absorption may be compared to that of a cellular elastic body containing a thick fluid in its cavities. Such a body, when subjected to pressure, is compressed by degrees on account of the gradual yielding of the thick fluid; and when the pressure is removed it does not at once recover its figure, because the elasticity of the substance of the body has gradually to overcome the tenacity of the fluid before it can regain complete equilibrium.

（14） 除了完美电介质的屈服之外，我们还有另外两种屈服，我们将其比作完美弹性体。由于导电性引起的屈服可以与粘性流体（也就是说，具有大内摩擦的流体）或软固体的屈服进行比较，在软固体上，最小的力会产生随力作用时间增加而增加的永久性图形变化。由于电吸收引起的屈服可以与在其空腔中包含厚流体的细胞弹性体的屈服进行比较。这种物体在受到压力时，由于粘稠流体的逐渐屈服而被压缩一定程度；当压力被消除时，它不会立即恢复其形状，因为在流体恢复完全平衡之前，身体物质的弹性必须逐渐克服流体的韧性。

Several solid bodies in which no such structure as we have supposed can be found, seem to possess a mechanical property of this kind; and it seems probable that the same substances, if dielectrics, may possess the analogous electrical property, and if magnetic, may have corresponding properties relating to the acquisition, retention, and loss of magnetic polarity.

几乎我们所发现的物体似乎没有具有这种力学性质的；同样的物质，如果是电介质，可能具有类似的电学性质，如果是磁性的，可能具有与磁极性的获取、保持和损失相关的相应性质。

(15)It appears therefore that certain phenomena in.electricity and magnetism lead to the same conclusion as those of optics, namely, that there is an aethereal medium pervading all bodies, and modified only in degree by their presence; that the parts of this medium are capable of being set in motion by electric currents and magnets; that this motion is communicated from one part of the medium to another by forces arising from the connexions of those parts; that under the action of these forces there is a certain yielding depending on the elasticity of these connexions; and that therefore energy in two different forms may exist in the medium, the one form being the actual energy of motion of its parts, and the other being the potential energy stored up in the connexions, in virtue of their elasticity.

（15） 因此，电学和磁学中的某些现象似乎得出了与光学相同的结论，即存在一种以太介质，它渗透到所有物体中，并且只在一定程度上通过它们的存在而改变；该介质的各部分能够通过电流和磁体而运动；这种运动是通过这些部分的连接所产生的力从介质的一部分传递到另一部分的；在这些力的作用下，取决于这些连接的弹性，存在一定的屈服；因此，介质中可能存在两种不同形式的能量，一种形式是其各部分的实际运动能量，另一种形式则是由于其弹性而储存在连接中的势能。

(16) Thus, then, we are led to the conception of a complicated mechanism capable of a vast variety of motion, but at the same time so connected that the motion of one part depends, according to definite relations, on the motion of other parts, these motions being communicated by forces arising from the relative displacement of the connected parts, in virtue of their elasticity. Such a mechanism must be subject to the general laws of Dynamics, and we ought to be able to work out all the consequences of its motion, provided we know the form of the relation between the motions of the parts.

（16） 因此，我们得出了一个复杂机构的概念，该机构能够进行各种各样的运动，但同时又是如此相连，以至于一个部分的运动根据明确的关系取决于其他部分的运动，这些运动是通过由相连部分的相对位移产生的力来传递的，因为它们具有弹性。这种机制必须服从动力学的一般定律，只要我们知道零件运动之间的关系形式，我们就应该能够计算出它运动的所有后果。

(17) We know that when an electric current is established in a conducting circuit, the neighbouring part of the field is characterized by certain magnetic properties, and that if two circuits are in the field, the magnetic properties of the field due to the two currents are combined. Thus each part of the field is in connexion with both currents, and the two currents are put in connexion with each other in virtue of their con- nexion with the magnetization of the field. The first result of this connexion that I propose to examine, is the induction of one current by another, and by the motion of conductors in the field.

（17） 我们知道，当在导电电路中建立电流时，场的相邻部分具有某些磁特性，并且如果两个电路在场中，则由两个电流引起的场的磁特性会结合在一起。因此，场的每一部分都与两个电流相连接，并且这两个电流由于与场的磁化强度相连接而相互连接。我建议研究的这种联系的第一个结果是，一种电流被另一种电流感应，以及导体在磁场中的运动。

The second result, which is deduced from this, is the mechanical action between conductors carrying currents. The phenomenon of the induction of currents has been deduced from their mechanical action by HELMHOLTZ and THOMSON. I have followed the reverse order, and deduced the mechanical action from the laws of induction.I have then described experimental methods of determining the quantities L, M,.N, on which these phenomena depend.

由此推导出的第二个结果是承载电流的导体之间的机械作用。HELMHOLTZ和THOMSON从电流的机械作用中推导出了电流感应现象。我遵循相反的顺序，从归纳定律中推导出机械作用。然后我描述了确定量L，M，.N，的实验方法， 这些现象所依赖的。

(18)I then apply the phenomena of induction and attraction of currents to the exploration of the electromagnetic field, and the laying down systems of lines of magnetic force which indicate its magnetic properties. By exploring the same field with a magnet, I show the distribution of its equipotential magnetic surfaces, cutting the lines of force at right angles.

（18）然后，我将电流的感应和吸引现象应用于电磁场的探索，以及显示其磁性的磁力线系统的铺设。通过用磁铁探索同一个场，我展示了它的等电位磁表面的分布，以直角切割磁力线。

In order to bring these results within the power of symbolical calculation, I then express them in the form of the General Equations of the Electromagnetic Field. These equations express- 
(A) The relation between electric displacement, true conduction, and the total current, compounded of both. 
(B) The relation between the lines of magnetic force and the inductive coefficients of a circuit, as already deduced from the laws of induction. 
(C) The relation between the strength of a current and its magnetic effects, according to the electromagnetic system of measurement. 
(D) The value of the electromotive force in a body, as arising from the motion of the body in the field, the alteration of the field itself, and the variation of electric potential from one part of the field to another. 
(E) The relation between electric displacement, and the electromotive force which produces it. 
(F) The relation between an electric current, and the electromotive force which pro- duces it. 
(G) The relation between the amount of free electricity at any point, and the electric displacements in the neighbourhood. 
(H) The relation between the increase or diminution of free electricity and the elec- tric currents in the neighbourhood. 
There are twenty of these equations in all, involving twenty variable quantities. 
(19) I then express in terms of these quantities the intrinsic energy of the Electromagnetic Field as depending partly on its magnetic and partly on its electric polariza- tion at every point. 
From this I determine the mechanical force acting, Ist, on a moveable conductor carrying an electricurrent; 2ndly, on a magnetic pole; 3rdly, on an ectrified body. 
The last result, namely, the mechanical force acting on an electrified body, gives rise to an independent method of electrical measurement founded on its electrostatic effects. The relation between the units employed in the two methods is shown to depend on what I have called the “ electric elasticity" of the medium, and to be a velocity, which has been experimentally determined by MM. WEBER and KOHLRAUSCH. 
I then show how to calculate the electrostatic capacity of a condenser, and the specific inductive capacity of a dielectric. 
The case of a condenser composed of parallel layers of substances of different electric resistances and inductive capacities is next examined, and it is shown that the phenomenon called electric absorption will generally occur, that is, the condenser, when suddenly discharged, will after a short time show signs of a residual charge.

为了使这些结果在符号计算的能力范围内，我将它们表示为电磁场的一般方程。这些方程表示-
（A） 电位移、真传导和总电流之间的关系，两者复合。
（B） 磁力线与电路的电感系数之间的关系，已经从感应定律中推导出来。
（C） 根据电磁测量系统，电流强度与其磁效应之间的关系。
（D） 物体中电动势的值，如由物体在场中的运动、场本身的变化以及电势从场的一部分到另一部分的变化引起的。
（E） 电位移和产生电位移的电动势之间的关系。
（F） 电流与产生电流的电动势之间的关系。
（G） 任意点的自由电量与附近的电位移之间的关系。
（H） 自由电力的增加或减少与附近电流之间的关系。
这些方程总共有二十个，涉及二十个变量。
（19） 然后，我用这些量来表示电磁场的固有能量，部分取决于它在每一点上的磁场和电极化。
由此，我确定了作用的机械力；第一，在承载电流的可移动导体上；第二，在磁极上；第三，在带电的物体上。
最后一个结果，即作用在带电体上的机械力，提出了一种基于静电效应的独立电测量方法。这两种方法中使用的单位之间的关系取决于我所说的介质的“电弹性”，并且是一个速度，这是由MM.WEBER和KOHLRAUSCH通过实验确定的。
然后，我展示了如何计算电容器的静电容量和电介质的比电感容量。
接下来，我们将研究由不同电阻和电感容量的物质平行层组成的电容器的情况，结果表明，通常会出现称为电吸收的现象，即电容器在突然放电时，会在短时间后显示出残余电荷的迹象。

(19)The general equations are next applied to the case of a magnetic disturbance propagated through a non-conducting field, and it is shown that the only disturbances which can be so propagated are those which are transverse to the direction of propagation, and that the velocity of propagation is the velocity v, found from experiments such as those of WEBER, which expresses the number of electrostatic units of electricity which are contained in one electromagnetic unit.

（20） 接下来，将一般方程应用于通过非导电场传播的磁扰动的情况，结果表明，唯一可以传播的扰动是那些横向于传播方向的扰动，传播速度是速度v，这是从诸如WEBER的实验中发现的，其表示包含在一个电磁单元中的电的静电单元的数量。

This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to con- clude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other radiations if any) is an electro- magnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws. If so, the agreement between the elasticity of the medium as calculated from the rapid alternations of luminous vibrations, and as found by the slow processes of electrical experiments, shows how perfect and regular the elastic properties of the medium must be when not encumbered with any matter denser than air. If the same character of the elasticity is retained in dense transparent bodies, it appears that the square of the index of refraction is equal to the product of the specific dielectric capacity and the specific magnetic capacity. Conducting media are shown to absorb such radiations rapidly, and therefore to be generally opaque.

这个速度与光的速度非常接近，因此我们似乎有充分的理由认为光本身（包括辐射热和其他辐射（如果有的话））是一种电磁扰动，其形式是根据电磁定律在电磁场中传播的波。如果是这样的话，根据发光振动的快速变化计算出的介质弹性与通过缓慢的电学实验过程发现的介质弹性之间的一致性表明，当没有比空气密度更大的物质阻碍时，介质的弹性特性必须是多么完美和规则。如果在致密透明体中保持相同的弹性特性，则折射率的平方似乎等于比介电容量和比磁容量的乘积。导电介质被证明能迅速吸收这种辐射，因此通常是不透明的。

The conception of the propagation of transverse magnetic disturbances to the exclu- sion of normal ones is distinctly set forth by Professor FARADAY in his “ Thoughts on Ray Vibrations.” The electromagnetic theory of light, as proposed by him, is the same in substance as that which I have begun to develope in this paper, except that in 1846 there were no data to calculate the velocity of propagation.

FARADAY教授在他的《关于射线振动的思考》中明确提出了横向磁扰动传播到正常磁扰动的概念。他提出的光的电磁理论在实质上与我在本文中开始发展的理论相同，除了1846年没有计算传播速度的数据。

(20)The general equations are then applied to the calculation of the coefficients of mutual induction of two circular currents and the coefficient of self-induction in a coil. The want of uniformity of the current in the different parts of the section of a wire at the commencement of the current is investigated, I believe for the first time, and the consequent correction of the coefficient of self-induction is found.

（21）然后将一般方程应用于计算两个圆形电流的互感系数和线圈中的自感系数。我相信这是第一次研究了在电流开始时导线截面的不同部分中电流不均匀的问题，并找到了自感系数的相应校正。

These results are applied to the calculation of the self-induction of the coil used in the experiments of the Committee of the British Association on Standards of Electric Resistance, and the value compared with that deduced from the experiments.

这些结果应用于英国电阻标准委员会实验中使用的线圈自感的计算，并与实验推导的值进行了比较。

电流的电磁动量。

(22) We may begin by considering the state of the field in the neighbourhood of an electric current. We know that magnetic forces are excited in the field, their direction and magnitude depending according to known laws upon the form of the conductor carrying the current. When the strength of the current is increased, all the magnetic effects are increased in the same proportion. Now, if the magnetic state of the field depends on motions of the medium, a certain force must be exerted in order to increase or diminish these motions, and when the motions are excited they continue, so that the effect of the connexion between the current and the electromagnetic field surrounding it, is to endow the current with a kind of momentum, just as the connexion between the driving-point of a machine and a fly-wheel endows the driving-point with an additional momentum, which may be called the momentum of the fly-wheel reduced to the driving-point. The unbalanced force acting on the driving-point increases this momentum, and is measured by the rate of its increase.

In the case of electric currents, the resistance to sudden increase or diminution of strength produces effects exactly like those of momentum, but the amount of this momentum depends on the shape of the conductor and the relative position of its different parts.

（22）我们可以从考虑电流附近的场的状态开始。我们知道磁场中会激发磁力，根据已知的定律，磁力的方向和大小取决于携带电流的导体的形式。当电流强度增加时，所有磁效应都以相同的比例增加。现在，如果磁场的磁状态取决于介质的运动，那么必须施加一定的力来增加或减少这些运动，当运动被激发时，它们会继续，因此电流和周围电磁场之间的联系的作用是赋予电流一种动量，正如机器的驱动点和飞轮之间的连接赋予驱动点一个额外的动量，这个动量可以被称为飞轮减至驱动点的动量。作用在驱动点上的不平衡力增加了动量，并通过动量的增加率来衡量。

在电流的情况下，对强度突然增加或减少的抵抗力会产生与动量完全相同的效果，但动量的大小取决于导体的形状及其不同部分的相对位置。

Mutual Action of two Currents.

(23) If there are two electric currents in the field, the magnetic force at any point is that compounded of the forces due to each current separately, and since the two currents are in connexion with every point of the field, they will be in connexion with each other, so that any increase or diminution of the one will produce a force acting with or con- trary to the other.

（23）如果场中有两个电流，则任何一点的磁力都是分别由每个电流产生的力的总和，由于这两个电流与场的每个点相连，它们将相互相连，因此其中一个电流的任何增加或减少都将产生与另一个作用或相互作用的力。
