Prophet of the New Force The Third Decade

"I feel that the world is waiting for this force; that this advance in science is necessary to keep the proper equilibrium in our age of progress. "

John Worrell Keely, 1885

“我感觉世界正在等待这种力量；这种科学进步是必要的，以便在我们这个进步的时代保持适当的平衡。” - 约翰·沃雷尔·基利，1885年

The year 1885 would find Keely still toiling away in his workshop in Philadelphia, perfecting his remarkable engines. As he wrote at that time: "I am in a perfect sea of mental and physical strain, intensified in anticipation of the near approach of final and complete success, and bombarded from all points of the compass by demands and inquiries; yet, in my researches, months pass as minutes.  The immense mental and physical strain of the past few weeks, the struggles and disappointments have almost broken me up. Until the reaction took place, which followed my success, I could never have conceived the possibility of my becoming so reduced in strength as I am now."

1885年，Keely仍在费城的工作室中努力完善他引人注目的引擎。正如他当时写道：“我处于完美的精神和身体负担之中，因为我预见到完全成功的临近，而从四面八方不断受到要求和询问的轰炸。然而，在我的研究中，几个月的时间就像度过了几分钟。过去几周的巨大精神和身体压力，以及挣扎和失望，几乎让我崩溃了。在我成功后反应发生之前，我从未想过自己会变得如此虚弱。”

And, while contemplating to devote less time to his work in the future, and taking a few days rest since he was so absorbed in his research and driven to the brink of utter exhaustion, he was now paying "the penalty." He also intended to withdraw entirely from all contact with the press, "in view of the unjust comments in certain journals." Keely would "give no more exhibitions after the one which closes the series;" instead, Keely wrote in a letter to Bloomfield-Moore, he would devote all his "time and energies to bringing my models into a patentable condition."

当时Keely正在思考减少未来的工作时间，并休息几天，因为他沉迷于研究而被逼近疲惫的边缘，现在他正在承受代价。他还打算完全撤回与媒体的所有联系，“考虑到某些期刊中的不公正评论”。Keely将“在结束演出系列后不再进行演出”；相反，他在写给Bloomfield-Moore的信中表示，他将全身心地投入时间和精力，将他的模型变成可以申请专利的状态。

In June of that year, Keely invited a number of reporters to his workshop, but had taken care in the invitations to suggest that only those should come with a certain degree of technical knowledge. At his invitation, five scientific reporters from New York appeared at the workshop. With them were J.B. Waring, a mechanical engineer, and a number of stockholders of the Keely Motor Company. When a reporter who arrived early was let into the workshop, Keely remarked that certain "curious bits of apparatus on the ground floor were intended for the junkman and not for use." Except however, a "large iron globular object, swinging on axes like a school geographical globe." Keely stated that this device was to be a new engine, which he was engaged in building. "Keely has risen to new things in the past year and a half," the reporter wrote. "He has not only discarded his old apparatus, but in making a new one he has wholly avoided any resemblance in appearance to the one he formerly used. Even those parts of the old machine which he said were absolutely essential for developing his new force fail to materialize in the present one. The machines resemble one another in this particular, viz., that both are impossible to be described by reference to anything set down in mechanical treatises. Even Keely confessed...his inability to describe the parts of his machine, and although he has given names to these parts he insisted on using different names when speaking of the same parts at different times."

在那年的6月份，Keely邀请了一些记者到他的车间，但他在邀请函中特意建议只有那些具有一定技术知识的人才能来。他的邀请得到了来自纽约的五名科技记者的回应。他们带来了机械工程师J.B. Waring和几位Keely Motor Company的股东。当一位记者早早地进入车间时，Keely说，某些“奇特的设备在地面层是为了卖给废品商而不是用于使用。” 然而，除了一个“像学校地理球一样在轴上摆动的巨大铁球形物体”之外，他说这个装置将成为一个新型引擎，他正在建造中。 “过去一年半，Keely已经迈入了新领域，”记者写道。“他不仅放弃了旧装置，而且在制作新装置时，他完全避免了任何外观上的相似之处。即使是他说对于开发他的新力量绝对必要的旧机器的那些部分也没有在现在的机器中出现。这两台机器在这一点上相似，即两者都不可能用机械手册中的任何内容进行描述。即使Keely承认...他无法描述他的机器部件，尽管他已经为这些部件命名，但当他在不同的时间谈论相同的部件时，他坚持使用不同的名称。”

Nevertheless, an attempt was made to describe the devices that he and his workman then assembled. Keely "brought to one side of the room a big piece of iron casting, and on this put a sheet of thick glass, making a stand. On top of the stand was placed a metallic bed plate about one inch thick, with holes around its edge. Tubes were placed upright on top and around the plate, and in the tube were rods. At one side was a cylinder about 18 inches high and about 2 inches in diameter...On the top of the plate and surrounded by the uprights were put boxes, cylindrical in shape containing rims from whose inner circumference steel wire prongs jutted, converging towards the center. Then a round cap was put on and bolted to the bed plate by means of upright rods. On top of the whole was screwed a globe with several apertures, to which tubes were affixed. The tubes led to strong cylinders like so called water reservoirs, only not quite as broad." When Keely thrummed over the steel wire prongs of his device, a sound like "piano strings" was heard. Then he attached two tuning forks to the device by screwing them into the holes on the edge of the bed plate. A third tuning fork, "about twice the size of these and mounted in a wooden frame, was placed loosely on the stand beside the machine." After some tapping and thrumming of the tuning forks and the steel wires, Keely announced that the device was now ready.

尽管如此，他和他的工人仍试图描述他们当时组装的装置。Keely“把一块大铸铁件移到房间的一侧，上面放了一块厚玻璃板，作为支架。在支架上放了一块约一英寸厚的金属床板，床板周围有孔洞。管子直立放在床板上和床板周围，管子里面带有杆子。在一侧是一根约18英寸高，直径约2英寸的圆柱体......在床板的顶部和管子的周围放了一些圆柱形箱子，里面装有从其内周杆突出的钢丝铸件，汇聚于中心。然后把一个圆顶加到床板上，并用直立的钢杆螺栓固定。整个顶部有几个开口，可以固定管子。管子通向坚固的圆柱体，类似于所谓的水库，但不是很宽”。当Keely弹奏他的装置上的钢丝铸件时，听到的声音就像“钢琴琴弦”一样。然后他将两个音叉螺丝固定在床板边缘的孔上，连接到设备上。第三个音叉“大约是这些音叉的两倍大小，装在一个木制框架上，松放在机器旁边的支架上。”在调整音叉和钢丝铸件时，Keely宣布这个装置现在已经准备好了。

He struck a violin bow against the largest tuning fork and "The force was then turned on by means of a tube into a little chamber or valve into which he had spit a mouthful of water. The chamber was part of an apparatus designed to show the pressure exerted. There was a steelyard arrangement with heavy iron weights at one end and a connection at the other with the water chamber." Keely then drew his violin bow across the large tuning fork, tapped the smaller tuning forks and opened some cocks in the device. Weights that were attached to the device went up.

他用小提琴弓敲打最大的音叉，“然后通过一个管道将力量引入一个小的腔室或阀门，他在其中吐了一口水。该腔室是用来显示施加的压力的装置的一部分。有一个像秤砣一样的装置，一端有沉重的铁重物，另一端与水箱相连接。” 然后，Keely用小提琴弓拉过大音叉，轻敲小音叉并打开装置中的一些龙头。附着在设备上的重物上升了。

The assembled reporters remained skeptical; it was, for instance, remarked that Keely had called a cylinder variously "molecular resonator, an etheric resonator, and an atomic presonator." The reporters were not allowed to touch his globular device or see the inside and noted a contradiction in statements concerning the device: "Keely said it was perfectly hollow and empty. His assistants said it contained some bits of mechanism."

聚集的记者仍然持怀疑态度。例如，有人指出Keely曾称圆柱体为“分子共振器，以太共振器和原子预共振器”。记者们被禁止触摸他的球状装置，或看到里面，并注意到有关装置的陈述存在矛盾：“Keely说它是完全空心的。他的助手说它包含一些机械零件。”

In the meantime Keely would claim to have made more discoveries while experimenting; "My researches teach me that electricity is but a certain condensed form of atomic vibration." It appears that he was still pushing ahead into the very heart of an avant-garde science. He would also suffer more accidents in the process; "I have met with an accident to the Liberator. I was experimenting on the third order of intensification, when the rotation on the circuit was thrown down in the compound resonating chamber, which, by the instantaneous multiplication of the volume induced thereby, caused an explosion bursting the metal casing which enclosed the forty resonators, completely dismantling the Liberator. The shock took my senses from me for a few moments, but I was not even scratched this time. A part of the wall was torn away, and resonators and vibrators were thrown all over the room. The neighborhood was quite lively for a time, but I quieted all fears by telling the frightened ones that I was only experimenting."

同时，Keely声称在实验中做出了更多的发现。“我的研究告诉我，电只是原子振动的一种特定浓缩形式。”看来他仍在推动前卫科学的核心。他还在这个过程中遭受了更多的事故。“我在Liberator上遇到了一次事故。我正在进行第三级强化的实验，当电路上的旋转在复合共振腔内被扔下时，由此引起的体积瞬间增加，导致爆炸炸裂了包含40个共振器的金属外壳，完全拆卸了解放者。那次冲击让我一时失去了感觉，但这一次我甚至没有被擦伤。一部分墙壁被撕开，共振器和振动器被扔到了整个房间。附近一段时间内很热闹，但我安抚了所有害怕的人，告诉他们我只是在进行实验。”

Keely constructed the Liberator after having entered a "new standard for research in an experiment often made by himself, but never before successful." The Liberator was the result of, and was much smaller than his generator of the year before.5 The generator was left abandoned after unsuccessful attempts to construct an automatic arrangement, which would have enabled anyone to operate his devices.

Keely在进行了一次自己经常尝试但从未成功过的实验之后，建造了一个名为“解放者”的装置。解放者是他之前一年制造的发电机的结果，而且比那个发电机小得多。在尝试制造一个自动化的装置，以便任何人都能操作他的设备，但失败后，他就放弃了那个发电机。

By the end of 1885, everything seemed to promise success for the following year.  Around that time, Keely wrote, "...before many weeks have passed, a revelation will be unfolded that will startle the world; a revelation, so simple in its character, that the physicists will stand aghast, and perhaps feel humiliated by the nature of their efforts in the past to solve certain problems. Taking all matters into consideration.. .the month of January ought to find all completed."7 News of all this reached the parties interested; the stockholders were jubilant, the stockbrokers were alerted and a great rise in the shares of the Keely Motor Company was expected.8 A New York newspaper even wrote that Keely had "imprisoned the ether."

到1885年底，一切似乎都预示着来年的成功。当时，Keely写道：“不久之后，将会展开一个启示，将震惊世界；这个启示的性质如此简单，以至于物理学家们会感到惊恐，或许会因为他们过去解决某些问题的努力的本质而感到羞愧。考虑到所有的事情……1月份应该全部完成。” 这一切的消息传达给了相关方，股东感到欣喜，股票经纪人也收到了通知，预计Keely Motor Company的股票会大涨。甚至有一家纽约报纸写道，Keely“囚禁了以太”。

In August, Collier wrote to Major Ricarde-Seaver who had convinced himself the year before that Keely "had grounds for his claims as a discoverer of an unknown force in nature." Ricarde-Seaver had done so while visiting Keely in Philadelphia and witnessing an incredible antigravity experiment; with the help of a belt and some devices, only vaguely described as "certain appliances which he wore upon his person," Keely was able to move on his own a 500 horsepower vibratory engine from one part of his shop to another. There was not a scratch on the floor and, later, astounded engineers declared that they "could not have moved it without a derrick, the operation of which would have required the removal of the roof of the shop." Ricarde Seaver did not make everybody happy with his adherence to Keely's discoveries. He was elected as a member of the Athenaeum Club in London, but was politely informed by Sir William Thompson who had proposed him for membership that he would probably lose his election by supporting Keely. He was elected, however. Collier wrote to Ricarde-Seaver that "The Bank of England is not more solid than our enterprise. My belief is that the present year will see us through, patents and all."

在8月份，科利尔写信给里卡德-西弗少校，后者去年拜访了费城的Keely，并在见证了一个不可思议的反重力实验后确信Keely具备成为自然界未知力量发现者的条件。在一些设备的帮助下，这些设备被模糊地描述为“他佩戴在身上的某些设备”，Keely能够独自将一个500马力的振动发动机从他店里的一个地方移动到另一个地方，地板上没有一道划痕。后来，惊讶的工程师们宣称他们“没有起重机是无法把它移动的，而且起重机的操作需要拆掉店铺的屋顶”。然而，里卡德-西弗的坚定信仰并不是每个人都能接受的，他被选为伦敦Athenaeum俱乐部的会员，但是威廉·汤普森爵士告诉他，他可能因为支持Keely而失去当选资格。然而，他最终还是当选了。在一封给里卡德-西弗的信中，科利尔写道：“我们的企业比英格兰银行更稳定。我相信今年将会看到我们取得成功，包括专利在内。”

Although Bloomfield-Moore remarked that, "The journals had ceased to ridicule, and some of them were giving serious attention to the possibilities lying hidden in the discovery of an unknown force, "12 the next year would find Keely's invention not complete for commercial use, nor any of his engines patentable, except for the Liberator. Up to this time, his experiments had been conducted upon a principle of sympathetic vibration for the purpose of liberating a "vapoury or etheric product."13 Keely once again was giving out demonstrations in his workshop, in spite of the fact that he had written the year before that "the loss of time and the interferences from exhibitions to which I have been subjected in the past" considerably hindered his research.

AI: 尽管布卢姆菲尔德-穆尔曾经评论道，“期刊已经停止嘲笑，一些期刊正在认真关注隐藏在未知力量发现中的可能性。”，但在接下来的一年中，Keely的发明还没有完全用于商业用途，他的引擎中也没有任何一个可以申请专利，除了解放者（Liberator）之外。在此之前，他的实验一直是以共鸣振动为原理，旨在释放出一种“汽化或以太产品”。尽管他在去年曾写道，“过去我所遭遇到的展览会所造成的时间损失和干扰对我的研究有相当大的阻碍”，但Keely再次在他的车间进行了展示。

Nevertheless, on one of these occasions, "there were some thirty or more invited guests present, including three ladies, all of whom took a deep interest in what they saw, the only drawback being the crowded condition of the room in which the exhibition took place."15 The object of his demonstration was of course his magnificent Liberator, which he had demonstrated the previous year to the assembly of skeptical reporters and with which he also had suffered the accident that had startled the neighborhood. The Liberator was now completed.

With his Liberator, Keely liberated his "etheric vapor" or "interatomic force," which he then vitalized and stored for use. The apparatus was about three feet high and weighed about 150 lbs. The Liberator stood on a moveable wooden pedestal, between two and three feet high, and was "entirely disconnected from the floor, wall or ceiling by any rods, pipes or wires, through which power from a distance could, by any possibility, be conveyed into the apparatus."16 The Liberator was "the producer of the force that, it is claimed, will furnish power to the extent of 10 tons to the square inch. It is composed of brass resonants, steel tuning forks, and two or three steel and brass dials. It is about as queer looking a piece of mechanism as could be found anywhere."

Like the year before, Keely first had to reassemble his Liberator before he could begin his demonstration, for "the shop was in disorder. Pieces of the Liberator lie about in every direction." Thus Keely showed, by having the Liberator apart, that there was no source of hidden power concealed in the device. The reassembly took him half an hour. Then, "Secretary Schuellerman went out and got a quarter's worth of lubricating oil, and Mr. Keely poured some of it on the piston of a big lever, then with a little copper tube he connected the Liberator with the lever."

The bewilderment of the spectators was apparent in the poetic description of the device. It had a shape that was never seen before in any machine and an interesting comparison was made to the description of the previous year: "On the top of this pedestal are piled the various circular frames and other parts of the generating or liberating machinery in symmetrical order, consisting of scores of steel-wire rods about three inches long, secured at one end and free to vibrate when struck or snapped, somewhat resembling the tongues of a musical box.

Radiating from these metallic frames are also numerous tubes screwed to their sides, one set standing out like miniature cannons from port-holes of a circular fort. Over this fortification is another similar structure surrounded with two score (more or less) of resonant tubes six or eight inches in length, secured perpendicularly, resembling a colonnade surrounding some miniature ancient Greek palace. Surmounting these singular parts is a small metal box, called the liberator proper, of very singular form, and which would seem to hold about a pint or so of gas, water, or other material, if it were not for the resonators it is said to contain."

Underneath all this was a large steel Chladni plate about twenty inches in diameter, which was fastened horizontally at the center by a "metal post running up through it." Above this plate were a number of tuning forks, and below the frame, and at one side of the pedestal, was suspended horizontally an oblong hollow cylinder made of metal, which Keely called a "receiver." In the cylinder the "etheric force" was stored after having been "vitalized." From the cylinder, this etheric force was led through a flexible, copper pipe "about three-eighths of an inch in diameter." The pipe could be bent in any direction so that it could be connected with different parts of the machine.

With a violin bow he tested the vibrator by drawing the bow over the tuning forks. Then he let out the air in the two-pint tube under the Liberator, and said he was ready to charge the little tube with vibrating power to the extent of ten tons to the square inch. The visitors looked on in mystified silence as the inventor, with beads of perspiration on his forehead, explained that the piston of the lever was a half square inch in area, and that it took 1,600 pounds pressure on the half square inch of area to raise the bare lever. Keely also explained that he used no water with his Liberator, but instead "got an etheric force from the atmosphere by vibratory action, which is accomplished with the Liberator, and that there was no impingement or abutment or visible exhaust from the pressure, except a slight sound."

Keely drew his fiddle-bow across three of the tuning forks, and as these sounded with what he called an "etheric chord," he struck the Chladni plate with a tiny hammer. The etheric force was thus liberated, the tubes vitalized and the receiver charged with some 10,000 pounds of pressure to the square inch that would, according to Keely, increase to no less than 25,000 pounds. A weight on a lever was lifted; "in order to assure ourselves of the full 25,000 pounds to the square inch claimed, we added most of our own weight to the arm of the lever without forcing the piston back again."

Keely then demonstrated his vaporic gun by leading the force from the receiver "by the same kind of flexible copper tube, attaching one end of it to the breech of the gun."22 Then, "He took some vulcanite and rubber wafers for packing, and then rammed a leaden bullet, one and one-half inches in diameter, into the cannon with a broom handle. An iron plate was passed outside of the back door. The cock from the given point tube was opened and the bullet went whizzing through the panel of the door and flattened itself on the iron plate. There was a report about as loud as the sound made by firing off a revolver when the bullet left the cannon. There was no recoil of the gun, and the barrel was about the same temperature as the atmosphere. Three bullets were fired in quick succession, and Mr. Keely said that there was sufficient power in the tube to shoot 500 more bullets..."

The famous Keely motor of which the world had heard and read so much, "a smooth hollow sphere of metal about two feet in diameter," and which consisted in a  horsepower rotary engine, was also run with his etheric vapor. "What is most astonishing about the rotation of this sphere, by simply turning on the vapor," a witness remarked, "is the fact that there is no escape for the gas anywhere, after it has done its work, nor any outlet or exhaust-pipe for such escape, as is well known to be absolutely necessary in the use of any gas, liquid or vapor known to mechanics, and by which engines are readily driven."

A description of Keely's "200 horsepower engine," on which he had been working "for some time," has also survived: "It is encased in copper and is full of brass resonants. It looks like a patent washing machine. Mr. Keely says it will be working in a machine shop on Vine Street below Sixth inside of 60 days, and that then he will be ready to take out patents. The machine can be put in any shop or factory, and will run machinery of 200 horsepower. With one expulsion of the Liberator of one- eight of a second the machinery will run all day. Mr. Keely claims that by simply charging the tubes daily with the vibratory power the machinery in a big factory can be run without even having a Liberator from which the mysterious power is originally produced."

Towards the end of 1886, Keely was hard at work on his vibratory generator. He would enjoy his first vacation in years,26 and would still be giving his regular demonstrations. On September 24, 12 persons witnessed his experiments "calculated to demonstrate the power of sympathetic vibration as applied to dynamics." "For the purposes of these experiments," a witness later wrote, "we were shown into an upper room about 12 by 14 feet in size, across one end of which extended a plain workbench. Upon this bench, extending more than half the length of it, were stretched two wires, tensioned to vibrate when agitated, the first wire giving forth a low note, the second a tone considerably higher." From this wire a small steel rod ran "really consisting of three sections, so arranged that the ends touched," and ended against a heavy plate of glass. At the end of the bench, a smooth, copper sphere of about a foot in diameter had been hung in a circular frame. The sphere was "expected to revolve by the force of sympathetic vibration."

One axle of the sphere ended in a rubber bulb, "like a small syringe." The sphere was placed between the thick plate of glass against which the steel rod ended, and a similar plate resting against the wall. The four legs of the circular frame also rested on a glass plate. On the bench were also two large tuning forks, 'fixed upright in their moveable spine resonant cases, standing some three feet apart, and the nearest one that distance from the sphere." Between the tuning forks was a small brass object resembling a snail shell mounted on a pedestal, which was called a resonator.28


At the opposite end of the room, "thrown carelessly upon the floor," was a flat ring about one inch wide, with a diameter of about forty inches. Fixed into this ring was a large tuning fork at right angles with its flat surface. Attached to the inner edge, and extending entirely around the ring was a brass tube half an inch in diameter. The two ends of the tube ended in a small sphere, "about the size of an apple." Resting on the floor, between the ring and the bench, was a small iron receiver that Keely called "double compressor." A small copper pipe led from this receiver to the little ball or sphere of the brass tube on the inner side of the flat ring. Another copper pipe was attached to the receiver and went into the next room to the Liberator. Through this long pipe, and through the double compressor and the short pipe went the vapor that charged the brass tube in the ring on the floor.

The beginning of the actual experiment was marked by the strangeness of it all; Keely obtained what he called "the mass chord" of those willing to participate in the experiment. He determined this mass chord by putting a steel bolt in the hands of the volunteers. It, which he called a "sensitizer," resembled a "car coupling pin, but shorter, and having a one-quarter inch hole through its length." From this sensitizer ran a 10-foot "hair-like" wire that ended in a reed whistle. Then Keely dropped the whistle into the snail-shell resonator on the bench. This produced a certain sound by which he could determine whether or not the volunteer held the right sensitizer. If not, a smaller or bigger one was handed. No two persons used the same size. After this unusual ritual, the brass tube within the ring on the floor was "charged with the force. A sheet of vulcanized rubber in the top of the double compressor was blown out "with a report that indicated great power, and, as Keely had stated that this rubber sheet would only yield to a pressure of 2,000 pounds, it caused "some of the brave savants present to seek positions in the remote corners."

Keely then went to the next room, where his Liberator stood, as well as another curious device called the "140 octave resonator." This was a brass tube of about four and a half inches in diameter and some eight inches deep. This mechanism was "supposed to be full of 'resonators,'" and the top "suggested an old-fashioned candle- mold." With this device, Keely claimed to be able to give 140 octaves.31 One of the volunteers then went within the circle upon the floor, within his hand the steel pin of his mass chord. Other volunteers then bowed the tuning forks at the command of Keely. The sphere "away across the room," began to revolve. "Slowly at first, but with an increasing speed as the forks continued to vibrate. When the volunteer stepped out of the circle, the sphere stopped at once; stepping back in the circle, the sphere 'immediately responded.'" Collier, who was present, tried it. To him this experiment was also entirely new.32
The witnesses were greatly impressed; "The entire absence of careful preparation, for the gathering, as shown by Mr. Keely's repeated search for objects needed at various points, that should have been gathered and placed where wanted beforehand; the change made on the instant by the substitution of one article for another, that was found to be misfit or would not work, etc., all added force to the results shown."33 This strange demonstration clearly showed that Keely had traveled a long way since the days that he wrested energy out of enormous engines.

In September 1886, an article appeared in Philadelphia's Lippincott's Magazine entitled "Keely's Etheric Force." It was the first article accepted by any Philadelphia editor, setting forth Keely's claims on the public "for the patience and protection which the discoverer of a force in nature needs, while researching the unknown laws that govern its operation. Up to this time Keely had been held responsible for the errors made in the premature organization of the Keely Motor Company, and the selling of stock before there was anything to give in return for the money paid by its investors," Bloomfield-Moore remarked.34 A month later, two Philadelphia engineers, J.H. Linneville and W. Barnet LeVan, made a thorough examination of Keely's Liberator, and the lever by means of which the energy of the force that was generated by the Liberator was measured. Both devices were completely dismantled for that purpose. The outcome of the examination was that the engineers both certified that a weight of 550 pounds was raised on the end of the lever during the test, showing a force of 15,751 pounds to the square inch. It was noted that the highest pressure possible to obtain through compressed air was 5,000 pounds to the square inch.

Elaborate etchings of his various devices were printed in a magazine the next year.36 Reinforced by, or perhaps in spite of, eyewitness accounts of experiments, demonstrations and the occasional examination such as described above, the controversy became heated once more.

Another visitor wrote that, "The 'sympathetic etheric force' which Mr. Keely claims to have discovered may be best described as coming nearer to the primal force of willpower of nature than any force yet liberated from her storehouse. Its inventor seems to claim for it that it is that primal force itself; he speaks of the breath of life which God breathed into man's nostrils at the creation of the world. Whether Mr. Keely's force is itself elementary or not, who shall say? He claims that at least it is the last and greatest step in the analysis of matter."

In the meantime, news of Keely's doings stretched out across the Atlantic. In 1887, in England a series of articles appeared in The British Mercantile Gazette, its June issue devoting more than eight columns to the progress and position of Keely and his discovery of the etheric force.

Keely, who by now had totally abandoned water as the basis of obtaining the power, directed his attention solely to air as a basis. As a result, he announced in a circular dated June 9, 1887, that he would only use a wire instead of a tube as the connecting link between the sympathetic mediums to evolve the ether and operate his machinery.

Apparently this would lead Keely into a whole new land of discoveries and possibilities, the exact nature of which we can now only speculate. A newspaper for instance wrote that Keely was involved in "making a flying machine,"40 and on December 14 a new statement by Keely, a "voluminous report," was read by Collier during a meeting of the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company at Sherer's Hall at Eight and Walnut Streets. In it, Keely reviewed his efforts and experiments since 1882, when he was engaged in the construction of a generator for the purpose of securing a vaporic or etheric force from water and air. When the device was completed, he soon found out that it was "impracticable owing to the impossibility of securing graduation." After a series of interesting but laborious experiments, Keely built a Liberator in March 1885, which he operated together with the generator. Although he considered this "a stride in advance of anything accomplished hitherto," he also claimed that, "Meanwhile new phenomena have unfolded to him, opening a new field of experiment."

As a result, Keely became "possessed of a new and important discovery," and he would not need his generator nor his Liberator anymore. "His operations will be conducted without either the vaporic or etheric force which heretofore played such an important part in his exhibitions. What name to give his new form of force he does not know, but the basis of it all, he says, is vibratory sympathy. It may be divided too, into negative and sympathetic attraction, these two forms of force being the antithesis of each other. As to the practical outcome of his work.. .Mr. Keely could make no promises. He had no doubt that he would sooner or later be able to produce engines of varying capacity, so small as to run a sewing machine and so large and powerful as to plow the sea as the motive force in great ships. Among the work yet to be done is the construction of a sympathetic machine of a very delicate character. While this will be a perfect vibratory structure itself, its function is to complete the work of graduation or governing the force, but as to what length of time it will take to complete the work he cannot say."

Keely's report was accepted, but a newspaper shrewdly remarked that "The most important fact contained in Mr. Keely's report was suppressed. The part that was not read to the meeting informed the stockholders that he had in contemplation the formation of a new company and that he had already sold a number of obligations for the new issue of stock in order to raise money to prosecute his experiments." And indeed, Keely told a reporter the same day that the obligations called for between 30,000 and 50,000 shares of stock, and that "the new capitalization would be on a basis of $15,000,000." He furthermore stated that his old shareholders would receive share for share of the new issue. He would retain about 40,000 shares.

The year 1888 saw the publications of both a curious pamphlet and a remarkable book. In July, the pamphlet "Keely's Secrets," written by Bloom-field-Moore, came to light. The pamphlet, which had "a wide circulation,"42 was both a theoretical expose and a defense against Keely's critics. In its pages, she trusted Keely's visionary ideas of employing his discoveries for a system of airflight on which he had started working the year before, and of a possible application of his discoveries in the cure of disease. The pamphlet was published by the Theosophical Society in London, who also published The Secret Doctrine, written by Helena Blavatsky, Russian-born mysticist, occultist and founder of the Theosophical Society. In the huge tome, she devoted an entire chapter to Keely and his discoveries, and spoke out in favor of him. From that time on, theosophists and occultists who were not already doing so would direct their attention to the enigmatic inventor from Philadelphia.

In September of the same year, Blavatsky published an article on Keely in a French theosophical magazine.43 The same month in Paris, Le Figaro printed the expectations of French inventor Colonel Le Mat saying that "the chain which holds the aerial ship to earth would be broken asunder by Keely's discovery. The nineteenth century holds in its strong arms the pledge, that sooner or later the aerial navy, so long waited for, will traverse the trackless high roads of space from continent to continent."

Farther away in the Austrian city of Vienna, an Austrian nobleman, the Chevalier Griez de Ronse, printed a series of papers on Keely's discoveries in a Viennese journal called The Vienna Weekly News, of which he was the owner. One of these articles mentioned that the attention of English scientists had been drawn to Keely's claims, in regard to having imprisoned the ether, by Professor Henri Hertz's experiments in ether vibrations at the Bonn University. "Keely, like the late Dr. Schuster, claims on behalf of science the right to prosecute its investigations until a mechanical explanation of all things is attained." The Austrian nobleman was well informed; obviously he had read the pamphlet of Bloomfield-Moore, whom he might have known personally, and he was also aware of Keely's imprisonment in a jail in Philadelphia which had happened the same year.

The year 1888 would also be overshadowed by legal matters. Keely would be sent to jail, this time because Bennet C. Wilson reappeared to claim what he thought was rightfully his. Wilson had a curious tale to tell. He claimed that he had sponsored Keely's first machines some 22 years ago.

Wilson financially supported Keely's experiments from 1863 until 1872, and he provided him with a workshop on Market Street. But as the years past, and Keely's experiments met with little or no success, Wilson got tired of advancing money. He further claimed that, late in August 1869, Keely said that his device would soon be ready for sale, but he needed funds. Keely then made an assignment in writing of his whole right and title with all interest in the motor which, according to Wilson, was called a "reacting vibratory motor."

Wilson's patience was "exhausted when his fortune was exhausted, and Mr. Keely turned to new pastures, and with new names for the machine he had in mind, he found new patrons." From 1871 until 1878 Wilson had not been able to get "satisfaction out of Mr. Keely." In 1878, Wilson secured access to Keely's shop and, he claimed, there stood the machine "upon which Keely was experimenting for his newest and latest motor company," and it was the same with which he had "practiced on in the old Market Street machine shop." So now, Wilson's bill claimed that these assignments Keely made to him entitled him to all the patents that Keely had taken out for the perfection of his motor.47
The only thing that Keely could do was to prove that it was an entirely different engine that he had been working on. In all this legal confusion, it was somehow overlooked that Keely had not obtained any patent on any engine that


had resulted from his line of research after 1871. Strangely, while always quick to bring that aspect under attention, the press fell silent over this important detail. This was unfortunately not the only legal case that Keely became entangled in. Sadly, the other case was once again directed by a faction of the Keely Motor Company, the very company that had originally been founded to support him. The case was a reflection of what had happened to Keely in 1882. In July, the same month that Bloomfield- Moore's pamphlet was published, four directors of the New York branch of the Keely Motor Company brought a suit against him in order to force him to "turn over his property to surrender patents, and to disclose his secret to some one appointed by them."

This suit was against the will of the three Philadelphian directors, who on September 8 organized a meeting at Keely's request. That afternoon, 60 stockholders met in the third-story room at Eighth and Walnut Street. Keely also issued a circular in which he stated that he had reason to believe the majority of the stockholders were opposed to the suit against him, "but he wanted to know definitely what they were going to do about it, as his own policy would thereby be shaped."

Not surprisingly, the New York directors were absent from the meeting, as was Keely, but he did sent a letter to the meeting, which was read. In it he wrote that he had received a number of replies from stockholders, "residents of New York and elsewhere, all of whom deprecate the revival of the suit against me and express themselves in favor of the proposition of reorganization of the company as submitted by me to the stockholders. I have also been requested, verbally and in writing, by many stockholders to take into my confidence Mr. J.H. Linnville and Mr. W. Barnet LeVan in connection with Mr. Boekel, and avail myself of their aid and advice in the matter of applying for my letters patent on my invention, and I shall exhibit myself of their aid and advice in the matter of applying for my letters patent on my invention, and I shall exhibit to them from time to time progressive experiments and explain the same to them."
The outcome of the meeting was that, of the 60 stockholders present, who held proxies for about 150 others, all were in favor of Keely. One dissenting vote though was heard when the reorganization was proposed. The proposition was to decrease the value of the shares from $50 to $20, but to increase the number of the shares to $250,000, so that the capital would remain the same.

The incident also demonstrated that, as the previous years had witnessed, the Keely Motor Company had never been a unanimous organization. Some of its members were driven by the simple prospect of profit, and profit alone; but those who did so would become greatly disappointed over the years. Others felt more favorably of Keely and perhaps shared the same sense of wonder with him. A clear indication revealed itself at a meeting held three days after the meeting on September 8. Collier, Thomas and William Clark resigned from their positions as directors of the Keely Motor Company. In their place Boekel, New Yorker George Hastings and Henry N. Hooper of Brooklyn were appointed. New Yorker Guilian S. Hook was elected Treasurer.

Thomas vented his frustration of the whole affair in a long tirade: "We withdrew as a body...because the suit brought against Mr. Keely by the Board of Directors of the Keely Motor Company"—here Mr. Thomas spoke very sarcastically—"was brought by the New York directors without in any way giving the Philadelphia directors any intimation whatever of what they were going to do. They did not do it in the board, but acted as a board themselves without any authority from us. They not only acted without our previous knowledge in the matter, but as a Board of Directors of the Keely Motor Company they appropriated themselves money to push the suit. To get the money... they sold the stock of the company at a great sacrifice. Of this I am certain. It was roughshod all through. We had no say in running the machine at all and were treated disgracefully. They ignored our Treasurer to such an extent that he resigned. Whenever they had any money to pay they would pay it themselves, and would not allow it to come within 50 years of our Treasurer's hands  After we discovered that the suit had been brought we canvassed the matter thoroughly and withdrew.  I see by the election that the New York directors gain practically two members and a Treasurer, leaving only one Philadelphian. Well, they are stronger now than they were before."

When on September 25 the new Board of Directors met at the office of the Keely Motor Company at 911 Walnut Street, it was expected that the Board would take action upon the decision of the stockholders at their meeting of September 8 to reorganize and thus increase capital stock to "provide funds for the working out of the inventor's alleged new discovery."

But that was by far not the most important matter to discuss, for Wilson's bill of January 3 had reached alarming proportions and the court proceedings of Wilson against Keely took a large share of the meeting. The directors also stated that "it had been decided to investigate 'a point' in the matter which, it is believed, will place everything right between Keely and the directors." This precise point was not explained. Boekel, who knew more about Keely's devices than any other man, gave the directors "a description of several interesting experiments recently made by Keely on his new 'sympathetic attraction.'"

Keely stayed confident. The machine that Wilson claimed he had the rights to, and the machine that Keely was working on were "entirely different." Keely informed the experts that he would be ready to show them his machine and explain its working, according to the decree of the court. The decree did not demand that Keely would "put the machine to work."50
Wilson's case against Keely was brought to the Court of Common Pleas, and the committee of experts which was appointed to investigate the matter was, from Keely's side, an unfortunate assembly. One of the appointed was Professor William D. Marks, who already had his dealings with Keely,51 and could hardly have been called impartial. Answering to a reporter on Collier's threat to have him arrested on a criminal charge and bring civil suit against him, he said, "Let me give you my statement of the affair.

...I think it was in 1878 that Mr. Collier approached me as secretary of the company and requested me to make an investigation of the Keely Motor.  In the course of my investigation, after I made
three visits to the shop of Mr. Keely, during which time I carefully watched all of his manipulations, I became convinced that the source of his alleged power was compressed air, located in a cylinder, which he called an 'expulsion tube.' I told Mr. Keely that I believed compressed air was concealed in the tube and asked to be allowed to take a monkey-wrench and unscrew a stop-cock in this tube, which would at once prove the correctness or incorrectness of my belief. I was refused both by Mr. Keely and Mr. Collier, under the absurd plea that it would 'desensitize' the machine. I then asked that they allow me to test a gauge on which there was an alleged pressure of 50,000 pounds. I was refused this opportunity also, on the ground that Mr. Keely desired to use this gauge on the following day. I asked this because I believed the gauge to have been tampered with. Then I said to Mr. Keely and Mr. Collier that both their machine and themselves were a swindle and a fraud."

Apparently Marks only joined the committee "at the request of Dr. Pepper," provost of the University of Pennsylvania, and in reply "to a very courteous note from Judge Reed."

Marks complained that the task was not easy: "Since this investigation has begun the committee has been shown a wreck which is apparently what is left of what Mr. Keely claimed to be the motor of 1878, and also a copper globe which has since been added. ...Messrs. Keely and Collier have refused to put together the machinery; to show its method of operation, or to furnish any explanation. A type-written copy ofthis alleged explanation, which is not any explanation, has been furnished to the committee. It is still my opinion that the Keely motor is a fraud, Mr. Keely a swindler and possibly also Mr. Collier."

Naturally Charles M. Cresson, who also was one of the experts appointed by the Court, and who also had dealings with Keely in the past as the chemist who analyzed his vaporic substance,52 said that the charge that the committee was hostile towards Keely was not true: "I was chairman of that committee, and I told them that we were not to inquire into the merits or demerits of this affair. We were simply to find out whether two machines were alike. If so, then Wilson's claim was good; if not, his claim was not good." Was Cresson impartial? It was Cresson who claimed to have been present during the past fifteen years at several exhibitions of the Keely Motor and who had said a week before to a reporter that it was his opinion that "No exhibit shown to me has to my mind demonstrated the fact that any of the work performed (such as the lifting of a heavy weight, exerting an enormous pressure per square inch, or running a rotary or other engine, or projecting bullets from a gun) is of necessity the result of any unknown or mysterious new force."53
Naturally Judge Finletter, who presided over the case, denied allegations that he had remarked at a dinner party that Keely was a fraud and should be put in prison.54 These were however, the ingredients for Keely's trial.

On November 17 at 10:00 a.m., the Court of Common Pleas was called to order.

Rufus E. Shapley, Wilson's lawyer, addressed Judge Finletter and appliedfor a writ of attachment compelling Keely to appear in court at once. Finletter granted the request and an hour later. With the attachment, Deputy Sheriff Pattison headed for Keely's house and workshop. Keely was not in his house or his workshop, but in the vicinity of the Court House. Pattison searched the surroundings of the Court House, but could not find him. At 1:00 p.m. Keely was still not found, and Finletter adjourned court until half an hour later. Ten minutes before the court was again called to order, Keely walked in, appearing "to be laboring under suppressed excitement but walking erect." He was accompanied by his lawyer, Joseph J. Murphy. The two quietly took their seats, and at 1:30 p.m. Finletter called the court to order. Murphy told Finletter that Keely would like to defend himself, which he would do with a written statement. Keely then arose, took off his overcoat and kissed the book. Meanwhile Finletter told Keely that "You have been brought into court on an attachment for contempt in not obeying an order of the court. You have now an opportunity to purge yourself of the contempt." Keely answered that he had done everything that had lain in his power to obey the court. He then read a long statement, "which he declared was true in every particular, giving an account of his interviews with the experts, who, he said, were hostile to him and unable through prejudice to make a fair report regarding the motor." After he finished, Finletter showed neither sympathy nor interest but instead, without for a moment considering or commenting upon Keely's statement, recited "in a low tone his decree, which he prepared during the reading of the statement. Finletter ordered that Keely 'shall be committed to the county prison to be kept there and confined in custody until he shall have purged himself of said contempt and until he shall have been legally discharged from said contempt.'" All the while Keely was standing in front of the Judge, "and listened attentively, his face bearing a look of suspense and anxiety." After Finletter was through, Keely "appeared to be dazed" and remained standing until Murphy asked him to sit down. Murphy immediately sent
word to Wayne MacVeagh, Keely's senior lawyer.

Keely left the courtroom in the custody of Pattison, and they went to the county prison. Keely and Patison crossed Independence Square, "followed by a dozen pairs of eyes," with Keely leading the way, and Pattison in the rear. The two walked out Samson Street to Ninth, where they got a carriage and were driven to the prison.

Notwithstanding Keely's typewritten explanation that he had given the committee, they too labeled his attitude as one of refusal; and it had been this refusal to disclose the exact nature of his discovery and to give information to the appointed committee that led Finletter to decide to imprison Keely for contempt of court. Cresson explained what that meant: "The commission was directed by the Court to ascertain such facts as would determine the similarity or dissimilarity of the machine and without any reference to their originality, economy or merit. The commission had no desire and has not made the slightest attempt to go beyond the narrow line of the duty imposed upon them by the Court. Four out of the five members which composed the commission reported simply the facts, which, briefly stated, were that Mr. Keely had not made it possible for them to do what they were directed to do, because he has not exhibited (except in dismantled condition) or operated the machine called the 'Keely Motor,' has not given them any intelligent description of it, and that he had obstructed rather than assisted them in their efforts to discharge the duty assigned them. They have done nothing to provoke or justify Mr. Collier's abuse."

Thus Keely was locked in a felon's cell in Moyamensing Prison.56 The carpetless cell was 9 feet wide and 14 feet long. Prisoner #150, he was locked up and left to look "gloomily through the small cell window out upon that gray November day."

He spent a "quiet Sunday" in Moyamensing Prison, and although the night was cold, he said that "he slept as comfortably as he could expect under the circumstances." When breakfast was brought in, Keely's cell was skipped, for he would have a "heavier breakfast" half an hour later. A reporter wrote how Keely "sat near the door and listened with deep interest" to a sermon during a religious service, and "While the inventor was trying to fill out his afternoon nap up in his cell, a number of persons were making anxious inquiries.  A few friends turned away when they
were told that nobody could get into the prison on Sunday."

In the meantime, it was declared that the Court's commitment left Keely "to fix his own terms of imprisonment," meaning that he should remain committed "until he purges himself of contempt by complying with its order to explain his motor."59 November 19 would find Collier, Murphy and MacVeagh in Harris-burg, where they were making applications to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania for his release,60 since "a very dexterous legal move had emanated from the brain of MacVeagh."61 Keely's lawyers secured a writ of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court, and he was released on a $1,000 bail.

A fortunate side-effect of Wilson's legal proceedings against Keely was that with this Keely was able to successfully defend himself against allegations of swindle, printed in a Philadelphia newspaper in January 1889. It was alleged that Keely at another time and place had been known as John Adam Huss, who had been involved in what appears to have been an elaborate swindle. Now, with Wilson's suit against him, he was able to prove that he was not.

Two months after his release, on January 28, 1889,63 Chief Justice Paxton of the Supreme Court, upon hearing the case, reversed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, and discharged Keely from the contempt of which he was adjudged guilty by Judge Finletter. The opinion of the Supreme Court was that "the order commanding Keely to exhibit, explain and operate his motor was premature, and that being the case the Court below had no right to enforce the attachment committing the defendant to jail for contempt."

The methods of the committee, and even its installment, were also considered highly dubious: "After issue was joined an examiner could have been appointed and the proofs taken in an orderly manner. Instead of so proceeding a commission
of experts was appointed to examine the defendant's machine." Keely was not only required to exhibit his device, but also to operate it and explain the mode of construction and operation, a measure considered to require "considerable expense to clean the machine, put it together and operate it."

Even though Keely's attitude was labeled as one of refusal, the Supreme Court thought otherwise: "The defendant appears to have been willing to exhibit it and in point of fact did so.  But to make an order not only to exhibit it but to operate it, the practical effect of which was to wring from him his defense in advance of any issue joined, was an improvident and excessive exercise of chancery powers. It is the more remarkable from the fact that the plaintiffs case, as shown by the exhibits and the drawings, was sealed up in an envelope and retained by the Court, access to the same being not only denied to the defendant, but even to the experts appointed by the Court."

Court of Common Pleas Judges Finletter, Gordon and Read grudgingly said that the Supreme Court was "laboring under a misconception when they reversed the decision of the lower court in releasing inventor Keely from prison."67 And so while the legal battle was over, and further legal details, pro and con, had become quite arcane, a newspaper concluded that "The right of imprisonment for contempt of Court is, and always will be, accepted; but when a vulnerable point can be found in the judicial mail, it will always be pierced to discharge the prisoner. The Judges don't just state it in that way, but that's about the way, all the same."

It would be a year later, on February 25, 1890, that poor Wilson would finally give up. Again his patience seemed exhausted when his fortune was exhausted. Keely's release "practically ended all litigation," a friend of Wilson said, "there was no way of getting the evidence in, and without it the case had to end. Mr. Wilson is not a wealthy man and he could not afford to begin a new litigation. It was proposed some time ago to clear the records by making the suit disconnected, but Mr. Wilson hesitated to do that until yesterday, when he had his counsel discontinue the case."69
Keely's release was wryly noted in the press: "Just as the sympathetic world was beginning to despair of ever hearing from him more, Keely, the motor man, bobs up again as new and fresh as when he first came to the surface, and assures us that his mysterious force is really bottled at last and that he is going to let some loose in a few days. Some wicked people will doubt of course and say they were told this before."

After his release, and during the winter of 1888-1889, Keely was turning his attention more and more to a series of experiments of a different nature. Perhaps his former experiments were done with a more or less commercial prospect in mind, but now he was fully concentrating himself upon the unknown force and its laws of which he still was ignorant. He admitted "that he cannot construct a patentable engine to use this force till he has mastered the principle."71
Nevertheless, and undoubtedly under pressure from the Keely Motor Company, he demonstrated a preliminary commercial engine in November 1889:


"before he had completed his graduation, he was induced...to apply a brake, to show what resistance the vibratory current could bear under powerful friction. A force sufficient to stop a train of cars, it was estimated, did not interfere with its running; but under additional strain a 'thud' was heard, and the shaft of the engine was twisted."72
In 1890, Keely was still amidst an astonishing range of new experiments based upon levitation. While its results are similar to those of antigravity, levitation is looked upon as the suspension or neutralizing of gravity, while antigravity is considered a force opposite of gravity. Although Keely had experimented with the suspension of gravity years before and built devices to do so, he was now turning his attention more and more to the navigation of the skies. This remarkable evolution in his ambitions was not that unusual. For years his experiments were limited to the production of his force, the raising of a lever, the firing of his vaporic gun and the demonstration of a vacuum greater than had ever been produced. Since 1887, he had been working on what a newspaper referred to as "a flying machine." A year later he pursued his research on a line that enabled him to show a certain progress year after year. This also meant that he never repeated his experiments. While discarding or improving upon his research equipment after having obtained the results that his theories would lead him to expect, he continued his investigations with the information thus obtained in ever-new directions;73 his thoughts traveling along the same lines.

On April 6, Professor Leidy of the University of Pennsylvania witnessed certain levitation experiments. Leidy was greatly impressed, and declared to a reporter that he was convinced that Keely had discovered "a new force, distinct from magnetism or electricity."

Another experiment that Leidy witnessed, and that resembled Keely's demonstration in 1886, was the application of the force through the atmosphere from one room to another "without any other medium of conveyance than a silk cord. The door into a little back shop, whose existence until then was unknown, was now open and a silk cord passed from the transmitter to a large bronze globe, which was mounted on an axis horizontally. The other end of the cord was not fastened to the globe, but to a slender bar of steel supported on an upright near it. A plate of glass an inch thick was between the end of the resonant steel bar and the globe. A similar piece of glass was put between the wall and the other end of the bar. Glass was put under the upright which supported the bar. Glass plates were also put under the upright which supported the axis of the globe. Keely then took a harmonica in his hands, and, allowing the silk cord from the transmitter to pass over the harmonica in contact with it, began to sound notes on it. When the sympathetic chord was struck the vibratory force, he declared, was conveyed along the silk cord. The bronze globe, which was about fourteen inches in diameter, began to revolve about its axis. The faster Keely played, the faster the globe whirled."
Having seen all this, Leidy was given to a futuristic extrapolation of his own: "Some day.. .I suppose a young lady will be able to play on the piano and set her

father's mill to grinding. I see no possible source of deception. This demonstration is wonderful. There is no explanation of the effect thus produced, except by vibratory force such as Keely assigns as the cause."

A month later, on May 8, Keely suddenly announced that he was finally ready. It was a rainy day in Philadelphia, with "nothing to break the silence of the street outside save the jingling bells of an occasional car. The air of the workshop, outer and inner sanctum, was as still as the murk of a tomb is supposed to be," a reporter with an obvious feeling for atmosphere wrote. "I have finished my work! I have discovered my force! I have accomplished my task!" Keely said to the startled reporter.76 He also told him that "there is nothing for me to do but to wait until the mechanics can make me a perfect machine. When that is done I will at once demonstrate my discovery to the world. That is my great, and, indeed, my only difficulty now! The apparatus with which I am compelled to work is, and has been, mechanically defective. When it is correctly made I will challenge the world to deny what I affirm with and through it!"

The reporter who dutifully wrote Keely's statements down was greatly impressed and drew an interesting description of him at that time: "John Ernest Worrell Keely stood with his elbow resting on one of his 'syrens,' the name he gives to a machine which sings, he says, and makes the atoms of universal ether dance. It was the first time I saw him alone, face to face," the reporter wrote, "Here he was, six feet one inch in height.. .heavy black eyebrows over deep-set, earnest brown eyes; high cheekbones over which rested the legs of the 'artificial eyes' his researches had long since reduced him to; a thick, black shock of hair, slightly streaked with gray; slightly bent across the broad shoulders and looking me straight in the eyes, with an expression at first guarded, almost crafty, soon opening into apparent confidence."

Keely also confided to the reporter that his force was "not like steam, nor electricity, nor compressed air, nor galvanism—it is none of these, and it is not akin to any one of them." He also made a statement that would become quite familiar in the years ahead of him; "Now, if outside mechanics can make my instruments, I am all right. If they can't, I will have to wait until I find one who can."

In 1890, the then world famous palmist Cheiro visited Keely's workshop,80 a place that was the scene of so many wonders. Forty-five years later, Cheiro would publish his memoirs of this visit, along with other materials about him. Although sympathetic, these memoirs do not serve to clarify matters as they are untrustworthy, as are his other writings about him elsewhere, which we will see in chapter 9.

According to Cheiro, it was in Bloomfield-Moore's London house that he first heard of "the Keely-Motor."81 At Keely's workshop, Cheiro amongst others witnessed his antigravity experiments and a "revolving globe of glass... It was of very simple construction, merely a large glass globe balanced on a pivot of platinum that, when spinning, kept its equilibrium by centrifugal action. This globe was also started by a vibration from the violin. When it had attained considerable velocity, Keely made me lift it off the table and carry the whole thing, wooden stand and all, several times round the room. As its revolutions became more and more rapid I grew alarmed, believing it might any moment fly to pieces. Again a discord from the violin and in a few minutes it stopped." Unfortunately, as Cheiro's account is inaccurate, the question remains open if this was merely a distorted memory, or indeed a description of a device that Keely had actually built.

The year that Cheiro visited Keely, foreign publications again wrote about him and his discoveries. In March the Anglo-Austria contained two papers on the subject, and in October the London periodical Invention published its opinion that amongst others, reiterated Professor Leidy's visit.

Yet in the autumn of that year, Keely would find himself again threatened with lawsuits and harassed by demands to give demonstrations in order to raise the price of stock. A subscription was even started to raise funds for the prosecution. Keely now found himself in a difficult position. He had to choose to either continue his research with, as the ultimate end, the completion of his system, or to divert his course and to resume his efforts on the construction and perfection of an engine that could be patented and made commercially profitable.

At this point, an attempt was made to hand out a written statement in which Keely explained that it would be far more profitable in the end if he could continue his research, since in the preceding years he had done "scarcely more than liberating the ether." The effort to circulate his statement failed, but instead an unfavorable expose of the history of the company was circulated.84 Around the same time news about him and his discoveries had not only been published across the United States, but also in foreign publications and theosophical magazines.

Towards the end of January, 1893, he invited 30 "sanguine capitalists and promoters" from Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and Boston, to his shop to investigate the progress of his work on the development of the motor. The delegation assembled at Collier's office at 910 Walnut Street and held a meeting with closed doors. Those present were also pledged to maintain silence on the details of what they subsequently heard and saw. Collier read a report written by Keely on the progress he had made so far, explaining the difficulties that were delaying his success. Those that were present said that, although they could not give out any details concerning the report, Keely assured them that success was imminent and a "limited time and amount of money he would require to complete the greatest motor the world has ever known." After the meeting the assembly was driven to his workshop where for two hours he demonstrated his devices and explained the workings of the different parts of the machinery and the application of the new force.

One who was present, a Jacob Bunn Jr. who was the vice president of the Illinois Watch Company, later told the press that he was not at liberty to give the contents of the report, or the names of those present, "except to say that they were men of large capital, who were accompanied in their visit of inspection by some of the best engineers and scientists of this country." Much of what he had seen was "wonderful," and he could only agree "with all the others, including the scientific men present, that Mr. Keely has discovered and utilized to a measure a seemingly new and powerful force which is understood alone by himself."

Keely said that he had provided himself with "suitable furnaces and tools," and would begin immediately with "the difficult task of making these wheels" himself. "I can make them perfectly," Keely allegedly said, "and when this is accomplished I will put in motion a power that can run a train without fuel of any kind or any other force for thousands of years continuously if desired."

Notwithstanding these claims, the public once again lost its interest, although the book Keely and his Discoveries: Aerial Navigation, written by Bloomfield-Moore, and published in London in October, fuelled the interest in England to a considerable extent. So much so that Prof. Dewar of the Royal Institution in England, who had "liquified oxygen" and was "the foremost chemist in England in all matters pertaining to gases" was asked if it was true that Keely would place all the facts relating to his motor in Dewar's hands. Two years before that, Dewar agreed to investigate Keely's engines if he went to America. However, by 1893 Dewar had still not visited America, but he remarked, 'Two days ago I received a letter from Mrs. Moore, written in Philadelphia, saying that Mr. Keely had completed his system and no longer needs sympathy or endorsement.

But that grandiose millennium of power—evoked by Keely's completed system— had to wait for another year. The end, though, was now in sight, or so it was told at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company. Only a small representation of the stock "put in an appearance." A minimum of 50,001 shares were required to reach a quorum, therefore, no meeting was held. According to Secretary Schuellerman, this was not that much of a problem since there was "no business of importance to be transacted" anyway, and the stockholders were already informed that "in a few months all the arrangements of Mr. John W. Keely toward perfecting the machine which is to revolutionize power production will be completed, and patents will be taken out in all parts of the civilized world." A 200-horsepower commercial engine that had been "in construction for a long time" was delivered to Keely's laboratory the week before. This would not mean that the device would be ready for use immediately; a "large amount of adjustment and graduation" had to be done, but when this was completed, Schuellerman added, Keely would secure patents for all of his inventions.90
The year 1894 came, and as a consequence of Schuellerman's statement the year before, excitement filled the air in Philadelphia. A newspaper reported that, "It has been known for some time that Keely has his motor about ready for commercial work... " a statement that was foreshadowed by a newspaper a year ago, which proclaimed: "It appears that Keely is still alive, and that his motor is once more just about to move. "92 But the years of hard labor had taken their toll on Keely; it was also reported that his eyesight was "somewhat impaired and he works under difficulties," a condition that was described by a visiting scientist of Boston as "half blind."

The scientist was so taken with what he witnessed in Keely's workshop that he confided his experiences in a long letter to a newspaper, which show a marked contrast with other, more superficial reports on Keely's doings. This was not that surprising, as the scientist admitted that, "Impelled by a life long interest in the wonders of natural science and honored by the personal friendship of Mr. Keely and a few of his advisers, he has followed the course of this investigator for years."

And impressed the scientist was: "I have seen a spectacle I would have pronounced impossible, according to all the accepted theories of physics with which I am familiar. Without apparent exhibition of heat, electricity or any other form of energy hitherto operated by man, I have seen a strong metallic wheel, weighing some seventy pounds, in swift and steady revolution by the hour, and absolutely without cost.. .Long we stand around that flying wheel. The friend who photographed it at rest, again levels his camera upon it. In vain, its spokes cannot tarry long enough to be caught in its snare. It is still as death and almost as mysterious. We listen to long dissertations upon the reason for the relative positions of the eight discs on the wheel and the nine on the stationary rim, and how the adjustment can be so altered that instead of a revolution there will be a violent oscillation back and forth. We are shown the corresponding wheel and the rim of the large engine close by which is to bear the discs, not singly, but in groups, the steel resonating drum with the circles of tubes inside, the 35-inch Chladni plate underneath, the sympathetic transmitter on top, the extra wheel bearing on its spokes cylindrical cases, each filled solid with a hundred thin curved plates of steel, to get the utmost superficial areas, we are told."

And where Keely had complained the year before that two wheels of copper tubing were made imperfect, and had stated that he would make these himself, the scientist now wrote: "The engine you have been looking upon requires as part of itself...certain heavy tubular copper rings. Skillful artisans failed in various endeavors, by electrical deposition and otherwise, to make them right. The inventor contrived machinery for bending into semi-circles sections of copper tube one and one-half inch bore, three-eighths of an inch thick, forcing a steel ball through them to keep the tube in shape. To make a ring he placed two of these half circles together, and joined the ends in some way without heat, by what he calls 'sympathetic attraction' so that the resonant properties of the rings are satisfactory, and though you see the line of union, the two parts cannot be severed. You see one of these rings, some fifteen inches in diameter, hanging by a block and tackle from the ceiling, and lashed to the lower half swings a big iron ball weighing 550 pounds and there it has swung for weeks."

Now was as good as any time to remember some good tales of the past; "Nothing is said now," wrote the Bostonian scientist, "of other wonders of which other witnesses can speak, and which are said to have appeared in the slow progress this incomprehensible man has been making all these years; of a pressure obtained from the disintegration of water by vibration, of 20,000 pounds to the square inch; of a slowly revolving drum which went no slower when winding


tightly upon itself a stout inch and one-half rope fastened to a beam, and no faster when the rope parted under the strain; of the disintegration of rock into impalpable powder; of raising heavy weights by aid of a 'vibratory lift,' recalling the 'negative gravity' of our modern storyteller."

The year 1894 would also witness the appearance of two remarkable and futuristic novels, written in the vein of the "modern story tellers," that bore a direct relation with the visionary ideas of the enigmatic inventor. The first novel, titled Dashed Against the Rock, was written by theosophist, freemason and medium William Colville. His book was written after conversations with Keely, portrayed in the novel as the character "Aldebaran." The character of Professor Monteith was in real life Prof. Wentworth Lascelles-Scott, an acquaintance of Bloomfield-Moore. In his introduction, Colville made it very clear that, "In presenting to the public the following extraordinary romance, I wish to be distinctly understood that I am not in any sense the author of the scientific dissertations and tables which form a considerable portion of the volume. ...The unusual and distinctly technical terminology employed in some of the most important sections of this story may be considered out of place in a tale containing some amusing incidents and ostensibly published as a novel. I had no alternative but to what I have done or suppress this priceless knowledge altogether, for I have only received it on trust from a friend who is its custodian in a sense that I am not. I do not pose as a teacher; I am in these pages only a recorder."

The most remarkable portions, aside from a wealth of materials pertaining to Keely's underlying philosophies,96 were clear and definite descriptions of a proposed airship that would be built in such a way that with it one could also travel to the nearby planets and stars.97 For these were the years that Keely was more and more contemplating not only a system of aerial flight, but from the text we may assume, even space flight. After all, Keely had been working on what was to become a complex engine for aerial navigation since 1887.

The second novel in certain aspects even outclassed the first; for whereas in Colville's novel we find rudimentary proposals for an airship, capable of traveling to the stars and nearby planets, in the second novel a ship did exactly this, all the way to Jupiter. This novel was A Journey In Other Worlds written by John Jacob Astor, one of the most wealthy men on earth and an acquaintance of Bloomfield-Moore.98 Both books showed something of the far-reaching nature of Keely's visions.

It also demonstrated that these were to be Keely's most interesting years, as they show something of the spirit and the mind of the inventor who was forever pushing back the frontiers of known science and even groping for the stars. In the process, he would construct device after device and discard equally as many, becoming utterly incomprehensible to his contemporaries.

A reporter later remarked that he "found himself unable to follow Keely's explanations of the abstract principles on account of his unfamiliarity with the nomenclature of the new science...," and that he had to "abandon all preconceived notions of natural philosophy if he thought to make any progress in the study of Free Energy Pioneer: John Worrell Keely the new power. The laws of gravity, as laid down by Newton, magnetism, as formulated by Faraday, Henry and others; light and heat, as outlined by Lord Kelvin, and the correlation of forces had to give way to this mysterious force, which practically creates something out of nothing, if we may unquestionably adopt the discoverer's theories."

But no matter how far Keely's inner vision stretched, little understood by some and more fully appreciated by others, the troubles with his eyesight continued, necessitating a medical examination. On this, Bloomfield-Moore wrote: "Last week I received a letter from Schuellerman, telling me that when the final trial was made of Mr. Keely's eye, he wept for joy that his sight was restored..."

To her, Keely wrote: "My dearest and ever remembered friend, it is with the most exceeding pleasure that I can thus prove to you the perfection of my sight; and to be thus enabled to gratify my most ardent desire of sympathetic communication by letter to yourself."
