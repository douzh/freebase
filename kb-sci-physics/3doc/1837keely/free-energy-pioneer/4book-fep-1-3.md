Prophet of the New Force The Third Decade

"I feel that the world is waiting for this force; that this advance in science is necessary to keep the proper equilibrium in our age of progress. "

John Worrell Keely, 1885

“我感觉世界正在等待这种力量；这种科学进步是必要的，以便在我们这个进步的时代保持适当的平衡。” - 约翰·沃雷尔·基利，1885年

The year 1885 would find Keely still toiling away in his workshop in Philadelphia, perfecting his remarkable engines. As he wrote at that time: "I am in a perfect sea of mental and physical strain, intensified in anticipation of the near approach of final and complete success, and bombarded from all points of the compass by demands and inquiries; yet, in my researches, months pass as minutes.  The immense mental and physical strain of the past few weeks, the struggles and disappointments have almost broken me up. Until the reaction took place, which followed my success, I could never have conceived the possibility of my becoming so reduced in strength as I am now."

1885年，Keely仍在费城的工作室中努力完善他引人注目的引擎。正如他当时写道：“我处于完美的精神和身体负担之中，因为我预见到完全成功的临近，而从四面八方不断受到要求和询问的轰炸。然而，在我的研究中，几个月的时间就像度过了几分钟。过去几周的巨大精神和身体压力，以及挣扎和失望，几乎让我崩溃了。在我成功后反应发生之前，我从未想过自己会变得如此虚弱。”

And, while contemplating to devote less time to his work in the future, and taking a few days rest since he was so absorbed in his research and driven to the brink of utter exhaustion, he was now paying "the penalty." He also intended to withdraw entirely from all contact with the press, "in view of the unjust comments in certain journals." Keely would "give no more exhibitions after the one which closes the series;" instead, Keely wrote in a letter to Bloomfield-Moore, he would devote all his "time and energies to bringing my models into a patentable condition."

当时Keely正在思考减少未来的工作时间，并休息几天，因为他沉迷于研究而被逼近疲惫的边缘，现在他正在承受代价。他还打算完全撤回与媒体的所有联系，“考虑到某些期刊中的不公正评论”。Keely将“在结束演出系列后不再进行演出”；相反，他在写给Bloomfield-Moore的信中表示，他将全身心地投入时间和精力，将他的模型变成可以申请专利的状态。

In June of that year, Keely invited a number of reporters to his workshop, but had taken care in the invitations to suggest that only those should come with a certain degree of technical knowledge. At his invitation, five scientific reporters from New York appeared at the workshop. With them were J.B. Waring, a mechanical engineer, and a number of stockholders of the Keely Motor Company. When a reporter who arrived early was let into the workshop, Keely remarked that certain "curious bits of apparatus on the ground floor were intended for the junkman and not for use." Except however, a "large iron globular object, swinging on axes like a school geographical globe." Keely stated that this device was to be a new engine, which he was engaged in building. "Keely has risen to new things in the past year and a half," the reporter wrote. "He has not only discarded his old apparatus, but in making a new one he has wholly avoided any resemblance in appearance to the one he formerly used. Even those parts of the old machine which he said were absolutely essential for developing his new force fail to materialize in the present one. The machines resemble one another in this particular, viz., that both are impossible to be described by reference to anything set down in mechanical treatises. Even Keely confessed...his inability to describe the parts of his machine, and although he has given names to these parts he insisted on using different names when speaking of the same parts at different times."

在那年的6月份，Keely邀请了一些记者到他的车间，但他在邀请函中特意建议只有那些具有一定技术知识的人才能来。他的邀请得到了来自纽约的五名科技记者的回应。他们带来了机械工程师J.B. Waring和几位Keely Motor Company的股东。当一位记者早早地进入车间时，Keely说，某些“奇特的设备在地面层是为了卖给废品商而不是用于使用。” 然而，除了一个“像学校地理球一样在轴上摆动的巨大铁球形物体”之外，他说这个装置将成为一个新型引擎，他正在建造中。 “过去一年半，Keely已经迈入了新领域，”记者写道。“他不仅放弃了旧装置，而且在制作新装置时，他完全避免了任何外观上的相似之处。即使是他说对于开发他的新力量绝对必要的旧机器的那些部分也没有在现在的机器中出现。这两台机器在这一点上相似，即两者都不可能用机械手册中的任何内容进行描述。即使Keely承认...他无法描述他的机器部件，尽管他已经为这些部件命名，但当他在不同的时间谈论相同的部件时，他坚持使用不同的名称。”

Nevertheless, an attempt was made to describe the devices that he and his workman then assembled. Keely "brought to one side of the room a big piece of iron casting, and on this put a sheet of thick glass, making a stand. On top of the stand was placed a metallic bed plate about one inch thick, with holes around its edge. Tubes were placed upright on top and around the plate, and in the tube were rods. At one side was a cylinder about 18 inches high and about 2 inches in diameter...On the top of the plate and surrounded by the uprights were put boxes, cylindrical in shape containing rims from whose inner circumference steel wire prongs jutted, converging towards the center. Then a round cap was put on and bolted to the bed plate by means of upright rods. On top of the whole was screwed a globe with several apertures, to which tubes were affixed. The tubes led to strong cylinders like so called water reservoirs, only not quite as broad." When Keely thrummed over the steel wire prongs of his device, a sound like "piano strings" was heard. Then he attached two tuning forks to the device by screwing them into the holes on the edge of the bed plate. A third tuning fork, "about twice the size of these and mounted in a wooden frame, was placed loosely on the stand beside the machine." After some tapping and thrumming of the tuning forks and the steel wires, Keely announced that the device was now ready.

尽管如此，他和他的工人仍试图描述他们当时组装的装置。Keely“把一块大铸铁件移到房间的一侧，上面放了一块厚玻璃板，作为支架。在支架上放了一块约一英寸厚的金属床板，床板周围有孔洞。管子直立放在床板上和床板周围，管子里面带有杆子。在一侧是一根约18英寸高，直径约2英寸的圆柱体......在床板的顶部和管子的周围放了一些圆柱形箱子，里面装有从其内周杆突出的钢丝铸件，汇聚于中心。然后把一个圆顶加到床板上，并用直立的钢杆螺栓固定。整个顶部有几个开口，可以固定管子。管子通向坚固的圆柱体，类似于所谓的水库，但不是很宽”。当Keely弹奏他的装置上的钢丝铸件时，听到的声音就像“钢琴琴弦”一样。然后他将两个音叉螺丝固定在床板边缘的孔上，连接到设备上。第三个音叉“大约是这些音叉的两倍大小，装在一个木制框架上，松放在机器旁边的支架上。”在调整音叉和钢丝铸件时，Keely宣布这个装置现在已经准备好了。

He struck a violin bow against the largest tuning fork and "The force was then turned on by means of a tube into a little chamber or valve into which he had spit a mouthful of water. The chamber was part of an apparatus designed to show the pressure exerted. There was a steelyard arrangement with heavy iron weights at one end and a connection at the other with the water chamber." Keely then drew his violin bow across the large tuning fork, tapped the smaller tuning forks and opened some cocks in the device. Weights that were attached to the device went up.

他用小提琴弓敲打最大的音叉，“然后通过一个管道将力量引入一个小的腔室或阀门，他在其中吐了一口水。该腔室是用来显示施加的压力的装置的一部分。有一个像秤砣一样的装置，一端有沉重的铁重物，另一端与水箱相连接。” 然后，Keely用小提琴弓拉过大音叉，轻敲小音叉并打开装置中的一些龙头。附着在设备上的重物上升了。

The assembled reporters remained skeptical; it was, for instance, remarked that Keely had called a cylinder variously "molecular resonator, an etheric resonator, and an atomic presonator." The reporters were not allowed to touch his globular device or see the inside and noted a contradiction in statements concerning the device: "Keely said it was perfectly hollow and empty. His assistants said it contained some bits of mechanism."

聚集的记者仍然持怀疑态度。例如，有人指出Keely曾称圆柱体为“分子共振器，以太共振器和原子预共振器”。记者们被禁止触摸他的球状装置，或看到里面，并注意到有关装置的陈述存在矛盾：“Keely说它是完全空心的。他的助手说它包含一些机械零件。”

In the meantime Keely would claim to have made more discoveries while experimenting; "My researches teach me that electricity is but a certain condensed form of atomic vibration." It appears that he was still pushing ahead into the very heart of an avant-garde science. He would also suffer more accidents in the process; "I have met with an accident to the Liberator. I was experimenting on the third order of intensification, when the rotation on the circuit was thrown down in the compound resonating chamber, which, by the instantaneous multiplication of the volume induced thereby, caused an explosion bursting the metal casing which enclosed the forty resonators, completely dismantling the Liberator. The shock took my senses from me for a few moments, but I was not even scratched this time. A part of the wall was torn away, and resonators and vibrators were thrown all over the room. The neighborhood was quite lively for a time, but I quieted all fears by telling the frightened ones that I was only experimenting."

同时，Keely声称在实验中做出了更多的发现。“我的研究告诉我，电只是原子振动的一种特定浓缩形式。”看来他仍在推动前卫科学的核心。他还在这个过程中遭受了更多的事故。“我在Liberator上遇到了一次事故。我正在进行第三级强化的实验，当电路上的旋转在复合共振腔内被扔下时，由此引起的体积瞬间增加，导致爆炸炸裂了包含40个共振器的金属外壳，完全拆卸了解放者。那次冲击让我一时失去了感觉，但这一次我甚至没有被擦伤。一部分墙壁被撕开，共振器和振动器被扔到了整个房间。附近一段时间内很热闹，但我安抚了所有害怕的人，告诉他们我只是在进行实验。”

Keely constructed the Liberator after having entered a "new standard for research in an experiment often made by himself, but never before successful." The Liberator was the result of, and was much smaller than his generator of the year before.5 The generator was left abandoned after unsuccessful attempts to construct an automatic arrangement, which would have enabled anyone to operate his devices.

Keely在进行了一次自己经常尝试但从未成功过的实验之后，建造了一个名为“解放者”的装置。解放者是他之前一年制造的发电机的结果，而且比那个发电机小得多。在尝试制造一个自动化的装置，以便任何人都能操作他的设备，但失败后，他就放弃了那个发电机。

By the end of 1885, everything seemed to promise success for the following year.  Around that time, Keely wrote, "...before many weeks have passed, a revelation will be unfolded that will startle the world; a revelation, so simple in its character, that the physicists will stand aghast, and perhaps feel humiliated by the nature of their efforts in the past to solve certain problems. Taking all matters into consideration.. .the month of January ought to find all completed."7 News of all this reached the parties interested; the stockholders were jubilant, the stockbrokers were alerted and a great rise in the shares of the Keely Motor Company was expected.8 A New York newspaper even wrote that Keely had "imprisoned the ether."

到1885年底，一切似乎都预示着来年的成功。当时，Keely写道：“不久之后，将会展开一个启示，将震惊世界；这个启示的性质如此简单，以至于物理学家们会感到惊恐，或许会因为他们过去解决某些问题的努力的本质而感到羞愧。考虑到所有的事情……1月份应该全部完成。” 这一切的消息传达给了相关方，股东感到欣喜，股票经纪人也收到了通知，预计Keely Motor Company的股票会大涨。甚至有一家纽约报纸写道，Keely“囚禁了以太”。

In August, Collier wrote to Major Ricarde-Seaver who had convinced himself the year before that Keely "had grounds for his claims as a discoverer of an unknown force in nature." Ricarde-Seaver had done so while visiting Keely in Philadelphia and witnessing an incredible antigravity experiment; with the help of a belt and some devices, only vaguely described as "certain appliances which he wore upon his person," Keely was able to move on his own a 500 horsepower vibratory engine from one part of his shop to another. There was not a scratch on the floor and, later, astounded engineers declared that they "could not have moved it without a derrick, the operation of which would have required the removal of the roof of the shop." Ricarde Seaver did not make everybody happy with his adherence to Keely's discoveries. He was elected as a member of the Athenaeum Club in London, but was politely informed by Sir William Thompson who had proposed him for membership that he would probably lose his election by supporting Keely. He was elected, however. Collier wrote to Ricarde-Seaver that "The Bank of England is not more solid than our enterprise. My belief is that the present year will see us through, patents and all."

在8月份，科利尔写信给里卡德-西弗少校，后者去年拜访了费城的Keely，并在见证了一个不可思议的反重力实验后确信Keely具备成为自然界未知力量发现者的条件。在一些设备的帮助下，这些设备被模糊地描述为“他佩戴在身上的某些设备”，Keely能够独自将一个500马力的振动发动机从他店里的一个地方移动到另一个地方，地板上没有一道划痕。后来，惊讶的工程师们宣称他们“没有起重机是无法把它移动的，而且起重机的操作需要拆掉店铺的屋顶”。然而，里卡德-西弗的坚定信仰并不是每个人都能接受的，他被选为伦敦Athenaeum俱乐部的会员，但是威廉·汤普森爵士告诉他，他可能因为支持Keely而失去当选资格。然而，他最终还是当选了。在一封给里卡德-西弗的信中，科利尔写道：“我们的企业比英格兰银行更稳定。我相信今年将会看到我们取得成功，包括专利在内。”

Although Bloomfield-Moore remarked that, "The journals had ceased to ridicule, and some of them were giving serious attention to the possibilities lying hidden in the discovery of an unknown force, "12 the next year would find Keely's invention not complete for commercial use, nor any of his engines patentable, except for the Liberator. Up to this time, his experiments had been conducted upon a principle of sympathetic vibration for the purpose of liberating a "vapoury or etheric product."13 Keely once again was giving out demonstrations in his workshop, in spite of the fact that he had written the year before that "the loss of time and the interferences from exhibitions to which I have been subjected in the past" considerably hindered his research.

AI: 尽管布卢姆菲尔德-穆尔曾经评论道，“期刊已经停止嘲笑，一些期刊正在认真关注隐藏在未知力量发现中的可能性。”，但在接下来的一年中，Keely的发明还没有完全用于商业用途，他的引擎中也没有任何一个可以申请专利，除了解放者（Liberator）之外。在此之前，他的实验一直是以共鸣振动为原理，旨在释放出一种“汽化或以太产品”。尽管他在去年曾写道，“过去我所遭遇到的展览会所造成的时间损失和干扰对我的研究有相当大的阻碍”，但Keely再次在他的车间进行了展示。

Nevertheless, on one of these occasions, "there were some thirty or more invited guests present, including three ladies, all of whom took a deep interest in what they saw, the only drawback being the crowded condition of the room in which the exhibition took place."15 The object of his demonstration was of course his magnificent Liberator, which he had demonstrated the previous year to the assembly of skeptical reporters and with which he also had suffered the accident that had startled the neighborhood. The Liberator was now completed.

With his Liberator, Keely liberated his "etheric vapor" or "interatomic force," which he then vitalized and stored for use. The apparatus was about three feet high and weighed about 150 lbs. The Liberator stood on a moveable wooden pedestal, between two and three feet high, and was "entirely disconnected from the floor, wall or ceiling by any rods, pipes or wires, through which power from a distance could, by any possibility, be conveyed into the apparatus."16 The Liberator was "the producer of the force that, it is claimed, will furnish power to the extent of 10 tons to the square inch. It is composed of brass resonants, steel tuning forks, and two or three steel and brass dials. It is about as queer looking a piece of mechanism as could be found anywhere."

Like the year before, Keely first had to reassemble his Liberator before he could begin his demonstration, for "the shop was in disorder. Pieces of the Liberator lie about in every direction." Thus Keely showed, by having the Liberator apart, that there was no source of hidden power concealed in the device. The reassembly took him half an hour. Then, "Secretary Schuellerman went out and got a quarter's worth of lubricating oil, and Mr. Keely poured some of it on the piston of a big lever, then with a little copper tube he connected the Liberator with the lever."

The bewilderment of the spectators was apparent in the poetic description of the device. It had a shape that was never seen before in any machine and an interesting comparison was made to the description of the previous year: "On the top of this pedestal are piled the various circular frames and other parts of the generating or liberating machinery in symmetrical order, consisting of scores of steel-wire rods about three inches long, secured at one end and free to vibrate when struck or snapped, somewhat resembling the tongues of a musical box.

Radiating from these metallic frames are also numerous tubes screwed to their sides, one set standing out like miniature cannons from port-holes of a circular fort. Over this fortification is another similar structure surrounded with two score (more or less) of resonant tubes six or eight inches in length, secured perpendicularly, resembling a colonnade surrounding some miniature ancient Greek palace. Surmounting these singular parts is a small metal box, called the liberator proper, of very singular form, and which would seem to hold about a pint or so of gas, water, or other material, if it were not for the resonators it is said to contain."

Underneath all this was a large steel Chladni plate about twenty inches in diameter, which was fastened horizontally at the center by a "metal post running up through it." Above this plate were a number of tuning forks, and below the frame, and at one side of the pedestal, was suspended horizontally an oblong hollow cylinder made of metal, which Keely called a "receiver." In the cylinder the "etheric force" was stored after having been "vitalized." From the cylinder, this etheric force was led through a flexible, copper pipe "about three-eighths of an inch in diameter." The pipe could be bent in any direction so that it could be connected with different parts of the machine.

With a violin bow he tested the vibrator by drawing the bow over the tuning forks. Then he let out the air in the two-pint tube under the Liberator, and said he was ready to charge the little tube with vibrating power to the extent of ten tons to the square inch. The visitors looked on in mystified silence as the inventor, with beads of perspiration on his forehead, explained that the piston of the lever was a half square inch in area, and that it took 1,600 pounds pressure on the half square inch of area to raise the bare lever. Keely also explained that he used no water with his Liberator, but instead "got an etheric force from the atmosphere by vibratory action, which is accomplished with the Liberator, and that there was no impingement or abutment or visible exhaust from the pressure, except a slight sound."

Keely drew his fiddle-bow across three of the tuning forks, and as these sounded with what he called an "etheric chord," he struck the Chladni plate with a tiny hammer. The etheric force was thus liberated, the tubes vitalized and the receiver charged with some 10,000 pounds of pressure to the square inch that would, according to Keely, increase to no less than 25,000 pounds. A weight on a lever was lifted; "in order to assure ourselves of the full 25,000 pounds to the square inch claimed, we added most of our own weight to the arm of the lever without forcing the piston back again."

Keely then demonstrated his vaporic gun by leading the force from the receiver "by the same kind of flexible copper tube, attaching one end of it to the breech of the gun."22 Then, "He took some vulcanite and rubber wafers for packing, and then rammed a leaden bullet, one and one-half inches in diameter, into the cannon with a broom handle. An iron plate was passed outside of the back door. The cock from the given point tube was opened and the bullet went whizzing through the panel of the door and flattened itself on the iron plate. There was a report about as loud as the sound made by firing off a revolver when the bullet left the cannon. There was no recoil of the gun, and the barrel was about the same temperature as the atmosphere. Three bullets were fired in quick succession, and Mr. Keely said that there was sufficient power in the tube to shoot 500 more bullets..."
