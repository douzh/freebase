# "分子跳舞的地方"：第一个十年

Where the Molecules Dance The First Decade

"A molecule of steel, a molecule of gas, a molecule of brain matter are all of the one primeval substance—the Ether. "

Clara Bloomfield-Moore Keely and his Discoveries, Aerial Navigation, 1893

"What ether is, no one knows. "

Thomas H. Burgoyne, The Light of Egypt, 1900

“一粒钢子、一粒气子、一粒脑质子，皆为那最古老的原初物质——以太。” ——克拉拉·布卢姆菲尔德-穆尔《基利和他的发现、空中导航》(1893) 
 
“以太是什么，没有人知道。” ——托马斯·H·伯哥因《埃及之光》(1900)

With the funds obtained through the sale of stock, Keely began the construction of a much larger multiplicator with which to decompose or disintegrate water, and with the vapor obtained he promised to run an engine. The multiplicator became a huge structure, weighting 80,000 lbs. and costing $60,000. Although the device was crude and unsatisfactory, the machine served another purpose; demonstrations were given to "satisfy popular clamor and boom the stock of the company." Its shares rose considerably and were bought and sold in the stock markets throughout the United States. Keely was by now one of the most talked-of men in the country, and thousands of people visited his workshop at 1422 N. Twentieth Street, admirers as well as scoffers and sensation seekers.

通过出售股票获得的资金，基利开始建造一个更大的倍增器，用于分解或分离水，通过获得的蒸汽，他承诺能够运行一台引擎。这个倍增器成为了一个巨大的结构，重达80,000磅，成本为60,000美元。虽然这个设备很粗糙并且不尽人意，但机器有另一个目的：进行演示以“满足大众的呼声，并推动公司的股票。”其股票大幅上涨，并在美国各地的股票市场上买卖。此时，基利已成为该国最受关注的人之一，成千上万的人拜访了他位于第20街1422号的工作室，既有崇拜者也有嘲笑者和轰动者。

But with fame came scorn; with belief, disbelief and rebuttal. Keely would meet his first major setbacks in 1875. Scientific American published a scathing article in which it was alleged that he and Collier were nothing more than frauds, "whose chief purpose appears to be the wriggling of money out of silly people." Keely replied in writing that he had by, "the introduction of atmospheric air into my machine, a limited quantity of natural water direct from the hydrant at no greater than the hydrant pressure, and the machine itself, which is simply a mechanical structure" produced, "by a simple manipulation of the machine, a vaporic substance, at one expulsion of a volume of ten gallons, having an elastic energy of 10,000 pounds to the square inch."

但是随着名声的到来，也出现了嘲笑、信仰、不信仰和反驳。基利在1875年遭遇了他的第一个重大挫折。《科学美国人》发表了一篇严厉的文章，声称他和科利尔只不过是欺诈分子，“其主要目的似乎是从傻瓜身上骗取金钱”。基利通过书面回复称，他通过“将大气空气引入我的机器，用从消防栓直接获得的有限量的天然水，不超过消防栓的压力，并使用机器本身，这仅仅是一个机械结构”通过“简单地操作机器，产生了一种蒸汽物质，在一次排放十加仑的体积时，有着每平方英寸1万磅的弹性能量。”

Collier wrote a long letter in return, including several statements by witnesses of Keely's demonstrations. Amongst these was the statement from G. F. Glocker, an employee in charge of the tool room for 26 years at the Port Richmond Iron Works in Philadelphia. Glocker had constructed the multiplicator for Keely "which he operated on the 10th of November, 1874." Furthermore, Glocker stated mat "in said multiplicator, there are no secret chambers or recesses in which chemicals or compressed air could be contained, and no spaces not fully accessible to a stream of water passed through the apparatus; further, that, in said apparatus, there are no pistons or moving parts other than valves. I have also constructed for Mr. Keely a vertical direct-acting double cylinder engine, having cylinders of 3 inches bore and 3 inches stroke, and a flywheel 24 inches in diameter and 4 inches face, weighing 2,000 pounds, which engine I have seen rotated at a speed of not less than 300 revolutions per minute with vapor generated in said multiplicator."

科利尔回信写了一封长信，其中包括几位见证基利演示的证人的证言。其中之一是费城波特里士满铁厂负责工具间工作26年的G·F·格洛克尔的声明。格洛克尔为基利制造了倍增器，"他在1874年11月10日操作了它"。此外，格洛克尔声明：在该倍增器中，没有任何秘密的仓或凹处可以容纳化学物质或压缩空气，并且通过该装置完全可访问的水流未经过任何空间；另外，在该装置中，除了阀门外，没有活塞或运动部件。我还为基利先生制造了一个垂直直接作用的双缸引擎，缸径为3英寸，行程为3英寸，飞轮直径为24英寸，面宽为4英寸，重量为2000磅，我曾看到该引擎在倍增器中生成的蒸汽下，以不少于每分钟300转的速度旋转。

All this was published in the Scientific American; nevertheless, the compressed air story would follow Keely doggedly in his shadow for the rest of his life and beyond. In the meantime, articles in the press rapidly grew in number and news of his invention was being published by most of the leading newspapers in the country.

所有这些都在《科学美国人》杂志上发表。然而，压缩空气的故事会一直困扰着基利，跟随他的影子，直到他的余生甚至更久。与此同时，新闻媒体的文章数量迅速增长，他的发明在全国大多数领先的报纸上都被报道了。

One newspaper printed a long article mentioning some of Keely's plans for the commercial use of his inventions: "Mr. Keely says that the first public exhibition will be upon the Pennsylvania Railroad, when he proposes to take a train from this city to New York and return. He will have the 'generator' stationed at West Philadelphia, fill the 'receiver' which accompanies the engine and take vapor enough to draw twenty cars to New York and back. The passage of the train will be silent. There will be no cinders, no escaping steam, or dropping of coals to set fire to bridges. The engine will be smaller than those now in use, but will be of greater horsepower. He says that the generator can either be carried on the train or left at a depot, according to the wishes of the engineer. It is small and compact and takes up very little room. For street cars, as a motive power, this invention, it is claimed, will undoubtedly become popular."

有一家报纸刊登了一篇长篇文章，提到基利计划商业利用他的发明：“基利先生说，第一次公开展示将在宾夕法尼亚铁路公司进行，届时他计划将一列火车从这座城市开往纽约并返回。他将把'发生器'放在西费城，用足够的汽油将随机搭载的“接收器”充满，足以将20辆火车开往纽约和返回。火车的行驶将是静默的，不会有灰烬、逃逸的蒸汽或者煤炭落下引起桥梁失火等危险。这个引擎将比现在使用的更小，但功率将更大。他说发生器可以随火车携带或留在车站，根据工程师的愿望进行。它小巧玲珑，占用空间很少。据称，作为动力来源的这一发明无疑会受到欢迎。”

Another newspaper wrote that Keely's invention, "if applied to navigation, the propelling power, it is said, would not cost more than $5 to run a steamer from Savannah to New York; and, as the necessary machinery will not take up one-fourth part of the weight and room of the boiler, engine, and fuel of equal power, another advantage would be additional carrying capacity and space for freight."

另一家报纸写道，如果把基利的发明应用到航海中，“据说推进动力的成本不会超过$5，可以从萨凡纳驶向纽约；而且，相同功率的锅炉、引擎和燃料所占空间和重量的四分之一不到就可以装下必要的机器，另一个优点是提高了货物的搬运能力和空间。”

But Keely's discovery would have many more applications; "Guns are to be fired by the same power that drives the ship that carries them; explosions are to be rendered comparatively harmless; engines of 5,000 horsepower are to be constructed so as to occupy no more space than an ordinary steam-engine, and all the marvels which are accomplished by steam are to be performed with infinitely greater ease by the cold vapor evolved from water and air." Notwithstanding all these grandiose schemes, some of the stockholders were becoming impatient, and, "not being men of science, are unable to see why we cannot patent what we have, and then patent the improvements that we are able to make."

但基利的发现还有许多其他的应用：“同样的动力可以驱动携带它们的船只和炮弹；爆炸也会相对减少危害；可以建造5,000马力的引擎，占用的空间不大于普通蒸汽机，并且蒸汽从水和空气中产生，可以比蒸汽更加容易地完成所有的奇迹。”尽管有这些宏伟的计划，但一些股东正在变得不耐烦，“他们不是科学家，无法理解我们为什么不能申请专利，然后再申请我们能够进行改进的专利。”

More philosophically, and probably with its tongue firmly lodged in its cheek, a Philadelphia newspaper had room enough to wonder and to point to the inherent dangers of such a discovery: "Such being the force of the new agent, the United States government ought to buy and keep a monopoly of it. ...With such a possession the country could defy the assembled powers of the earth. ...There is one thing that may save us—the one thing that seems to have thus far delayed the practical use of the new power; it is so subtle that no vessel of any kind of material will long contain it. The vapor from a pint of water penetrated through the pores of an iron receiver three and a half inches thick, forming a damp circle of three feet radius on the floor around."

更深度的哲学思考下，也许有点玩笑的是，一家费城的报纸有足够的空间来探讨并指出这项发现的固有危险：「由于这种新能源的力量，美国政府应该购买并保持其垄断地位……有了这样的所有权，这个国家就能够抵御地球上所有国家的集体力量……但是有一件事情可能拯救我们——这是一切迄今为止延迟了实际使用这种新能源的一件事。这个原因是因为这个能源如此微妙，以至于任何材料的容器都无法长时间地容纳它。一品脱水的蒸汽穿过一个厚三英寸的铁接收器的孔隙，形成一个半径三英尺的潮湿圆圈。」

In the winter of 1875-1876, Keely constructed two metallic spheres, one was about thirty inches in diameter that hung like "an ordinary terrestrial globe." This device, Keely claimed, would revolve with a force equal to two horsepower and would continue to run when started "as long as the Centennial Exhibition would be open, and until the device would be worn out by friction." The device produced power through what was described as "a peculiar-shaped hole in a sphere of iron."

在1875-1876年的冬天，基利制造了两个金属球，一个直径约为30英寸，像「普通的地球仪」一样悬挂着。基利声称，这个装置会以相当于两匹马力的力量旋转，并且只要启动就会继续运行「只要世纪展览会开放，直到装置被摩擦磨损。」这个装置通过「铁球上的一种独特形状的孔洞」产生力量。

A very sketchy report of the workings of the device has survived. Keely started explaining its working by writing some figures in chalk on a blackboard: "Keely pretended to explain this phenomenon by a string of unintelligible jargon, but the point of all this was that he said the thing ran in consequence of its internal mechanical arrangement—or, in other words, that by combining pieces of metal in a certain way power was generated without any other expense than that required to construct the apparatus. Naturally he refused to show the interior construction which did the miracle, but if his statements were true, it existed inside that globe, and could be produced indefinitely with the result of producing an indefinite amount of horsepower without current expense."

关于这个装置的工作方式，只有一个非常简略的报告保存了下来。基利开始在黑板上写一些数字，以解释它的工作原理："基利用一串难以理解的术语来解释这种现象，但是这些术语的重点是，他说这个东西运转是由于其内部的机械安排——或者换句话说，通过以某种方式组合金属件，可以在不需要其他费用的情况下产生能量，只需要建造装置即可。自然而然地，他拒绝展示内部构造做的奇迹，但如果他的说法是真的，那么它存在于那个球体内部，并且可以无限地产生动力，从而产生无限量的马力，而不需要任何电费。"

The stock of the Keely Motor Company rose considerably, about 600 percent, and stockholders expressed their wishes that Keely would patent the device. However, he refused to do so. Disappointed, some stockholders sold their stock and left, and the stock gradually declined.

基利电机公司的股票大幅上涨，约为600％，股东表达了要求基利专利该设备的愿望。但是，他拒绝这样做。一些股东感到失望，出售了他们的股票并离开了，股票逐渐下跌。

In 1877, a committee of the Franklin Institute witnessed some of Keely's experiments at his invitation, but were not permitted to see anything but the results. Many people, scientific and otherwise, would visit Keely's workshop by invitation, but there was no agreement regarding the character of the experiments. Machinists,
physicists and engineers generally were disinclined to believe that any new force had been demonstrated by the experiments, but the vast majority of those who were permitted to see the experiments were convinced that his invention was "destined to revolutionize the world."

1877年，富兰克林学院的一个委员会受邀观看了基利的一些实验，但未被允许看到除结果外的任何东西。许多科学和非科学人士会应邀参观基利的车间，但是关于实验的性质并没有达成一致意见。机械师、物理学家和工程师通常不愿意相信任何新的力量已经被实验证明，但被允许观察实验的绝大多数人都确信他的发明“注定要彻底改变世界”。

That year, Keely also completed an improved machine and was "about to submit it to a thorough scientific test." This new machine was described as being "placed on an iron bed-plate, two cylinders, or upright tubes, on each end, 8 feet high, the right-hand one 12 inches in diameter, that on the left 9 inches in diameter, each three inches bore on the inside. Wrought-iron rings are shrunk on these tubes to strengthen them. At different distances, graduated to a gauge to show pressure on the top and bottom, are compressing valves. In the center between these cylinders, at the top, is a sphere of fourteen gallons capacity, with three tubes connecting it with a middle one, smaller, which rests on a chamber, tea-cup shaped, and in turn rests on an octagonal box, which is fixed to the bed-plate, known as the expulsion-box of the machine. On each side of the central portion is a shell fourteen inches in diameter, seven inches inside, resting on a base through which is a three-quarter inch tube. One tube connects the shell with the expulsion-box, and all are bolted strongly together. On a line with the side shells rests what is called the expulsion-lever, and, singular as it may sound to those who have never seen the operation, this lever opens communication with all parts of the machine, producing vibrating action and the vapor, that impalpable thing about which there has been so much speculation. Connected by small copper tubes, not over three-fourths of an inch in diameter, are two very large spheres of steel—one, termed 'the register of force,' with a capacity of 12,5 gallons and 9 inches thick: the other, 60 gallons and 6 inches thick—the two becoming reservoirs of the power."

那一年，基利完成了一台改进的机器，并“准备对其进行全面的科学测试”。这台新机器被描述为“放置在一个铁底板上，两个圆柱或竖立管，每个末端高达8英尺，右边的直径为12英寸，左边的直径为9英寸，内部孔径为3英寸。这些管子上缩小了锻铁环以加强它们的强度。在不同的距离上，刻度到一个压力计上，显示顶部和底部的压力，有压缩阀。在这两个气缸的中心，顶部是一个14加仑容量的球体，有三个管子连接它与一个较小的中心管子，这个管子呈茶杯形状，再次靠在一个八边形盒子上，这个盒子被固定在底板上，称为机器的排出盒子。在中央部分的两侧，每个直径为14英寸，内部为7英寸的外壳，靠在一个底座上，通过一个三分之一英寸的管子。一个管子将外壳连接到排出箱，所有部件都被紧紧地螺栓在一起。在侧壳的一条线上放置了称为排出杠杆的东西，对于那些从未见过这个操作的人来说，这个杠杆打开了机器各个部分之间的联系，产生了振动运动和蒸汽，这是一个关于这个无法触摸的事物的许多猜测。通过小铜管连接着两个非常大的钢球，一个容量为12.5加仑，厚度为9英寸，被称为“力量登记簿”，另一个有60加仑，厚度为6英寸，两个球成为了动力的储存器。

The operation was apparently simpler than the complex structure of the device suggested; a rubber hose, five-eighths of an inch, would be attached to the hydrant, and two or three gallons of water was poured into the device. The gauges, with graduated scales, would indicate the height of the water column, "the result, varying as it does, so far as power is concerned."

这个操作似乎比设备的复杂结构所暗示的要简单得多；一个橡胶软管，五八英寸，将被连接到消防栓上，然后向设备中倒入两三加仑的水。带有刻度的仪表将指示水柱的高度，“结果，就动力而言，是多种多样的。”

Air was then forced in the upright left column with a pump. The pressure that was applied was "usually about five pounds" and sometimes "as much as ten pounds." By application of mere air, or by "bleeding of the gauges," the pressure was "regulated at will," and Keely's device was "what is technically called, set." The power was made from "hydrant water and ordinary air, no chemicals about it, and it will drive an engine and transmit power," as the vapor passed from the device into a steel shell and into a condensing apparatus. From there it went through a "small tube and thence to the engine."

然后用泵向竖立的左侧柱子中注入空气。施加的压力“通常约为五磅”，有时“多达十磅”。通过仅仅使用空气或者“放血计量器”，可以随意“调节压力”，基利的设备被称为“技术上的设置”。功率来自于“消防栓水和普通的空气，没有任何化学物质，它可以驱动发动机和传递动力”，因为蒸汽从设备中通过一具钢壳和冷凝装置进入。从那里经过一根“小管道，然后到达发动机”。

During a private demonstration, the valves "were all opened to show the machine was clear, air introduced and the lever was lifted, the first move showing 1,750 pound pressure on the gauge to the square inch, and though the chamber for condensing was open the current did not blow out a match held over it. With 6,5 pounds air pressure, the gauge indicated 5,200 pound to the inch and then 6,700 on the third trial. On the fourth it lifted a large lever (weighted) registering 5,000 pounds dead weight. The vapor was turned into an expulsion chamber and the cap flew off with a report like a rifle, frightening half those present, and lastly a 5 horsepower engine with 3/4 inch stroke and twenty-four-inch flywheel, was driven at 680 revolutions to the minute." What else could "the skeptical engineers" who were present do but mutter that they "were convinced that the power was there, and that it could be applied"?

在一次私人展示中，“阀门全部打开以显示机器不含任何物质，引入空气并提起杠杆，第一次移动表明每平方英寸1,750磅压力，虽然冷凝室是开放的，但点燃的火柴并没有被吹灭。在6.5磅气压下，计量器指示每英寸5,200磅，然后在第三次试验时为6,700磅。在第四次试验中，它提起一个大杠杆（加权），标志着5,000磅的静态负荷。蒸汽被转换为排气室，盖子像步枪一样发出响声，吓了一半在场的人，最后一个有0.75英寸冲程和24英寸飞轮的5马力发动机，以每分钟680转的速度驱动。”在场的“怀疑的工程师”除了嘟囔着他们“确信力量已经存在，它可以被应用”外，别无选择。

In 1878, Keely was still busy constructing strange-looking devices, conducting extraordinary experiments and giving the occasional demonstration, but not producing anything of commercial value or ready use, and still no patent secured. Naturally, this lack of progress would be reflected in the press, and in 1878 the tone in
the newspapers had changed markedly. Although most of these had been critical but objective at the start of Keely's remarkable career, now articles began to be published that were skeptical and sometimes even outright hostile in tone. In February, Keely wrote a letter to Edison, inviting him to visit his workshop and inspect his inventions: "Dear Sir, you have doubtless heard of my invention known exclusively through the newspapers as the 'Keely Motor.' My discovery consists in obtaining from air + water through vibratory action an elastic substance of great energy + capable of the same influences which produced absorption in water, giving a vacuum. Thinking that perhaps from your long experiments + extended knowledge in vibratory forces, be interested in seeing the operation of my invention I take the liberty of extending to you an invitation to visit my place at some time that may be convenient to you where I'd take pleasure in snowing you my machine and operating it for you.... " Interestingly, Edison had started working on the first crude talking machine late in 1877, a forerunner of his phonograph that would be patented in 1878. But around 1878 Edison was also experimenting with more exotic devices, one called a vocal engine that operated on sound waves, which he also patented in the same year.

1878年，基利仍在忙于制造奇怪的装置，进行着非凡的实验，并偶尔展示，但没有生产任何商业价值或直接使用的东西，且仍未获得专利。显然，这种进展缺乏将在新闻中反映出来，在基利非凡职业生涯开始时，大多数新闻报道都是批评但客观的，但现在开始发表的文章却是怀疑的，有时甚至是明确的敌对态度。在2月份，基利写信邀请爱迪生参观他的工厂并检查他的发明：“尊敬的先生，您无疑已经通过报纸听说过我独家发明的‘基利马达’。我的发现在于通过振动作用从空气和水中获得一种具有极大能量和可以产生吸收作用，在水中产生真空的弹性物质。我认为您可能会对我发明的操作感到感兴趣，希望您能在方便的时间来参观我的工作室，我将很高兴为您展示我的机器并为您演示。”有趣的是，爱迪生在1877年末开始研究第一台粗糙的口语机，它是留声机的前身，该留声机在1878年获得了专利。但在1878年左右，爱迪生还试验了更多的奇异装置之一，称为声波发动机，该发动机依靠声波运行，并于同一年获得了专利。

A person named Lynch offered to accompany Edison to Keely's workshop, but Edison's reply was curt. In a letter to Lynch, written on August 30, 1878, months after Keely's invitation, he wrote: "Collier just visited me. Keeley (sic) only willing to show pressure. I will not go until he works an engine." In the end, Edison never came to Keely's workshop, giving rise to the legend that Keely refused to invite him.

一位名叫林奇的人提出陪同爱迪生去基利的工作室，但爱迪生的回复很简短。在1878年8月30日写给林奇的一封信中，这是在基利的邀请几个月后，他写道：“科利尔刚刚拜访了我。基利只愿意展示压力。在他运转引擎之前，我不会去。”最终，爱迪生从未去过基利的工作室，这就引发了一个传说，即基利拒绝邀请他的说法。

In March, a statement was published in which J.B. Knight, secretary of the Franklin Institute, announced, after examinations that had lasted for a period of five months, that he had reasons to suspect that the gauges on the motors which had registered 11,000 lb. to the square inch were altered. He also stated that he thought that the machinery was made "large and massive for the purpose of misleading those who care to view it and every one else...," and that "in operating the engine, no vacuum was produced or utilized as claimed." Knight therefore concluded that Keely's multiplicator with its attachments, including the reacting device, were not capable of producing the effects claimed. The enormous strength was, according to Knight, "entirely unnecessary in sustaining the pressure to which they are subjected, but are rather calculated to astonish and mislead those who witness his experiments." In his opinion, the extreme high pressure that Keely claimed was not produced, "probably in no case exceeding 500 pounds per square inch, and that the readings of the gauges and weighted lever apparatus were incorrect." Keely's vacuum was not produced by a condensation or absorption of the alleged vapor, but by mechanical means, "such as a previously exhausted chamber or its equivalents." Keely's vapor was to him "simply atmospheric air which had been previously compressed and stored up in the various hollow spheres and other chambers of the apparatus in the intervals between the experiments."

三月份，富兰克林研究所的秘书J.B.奈特在一份声明中宣布，在持续了五个月的调查后，他有理由怀疑记录了11,000磅/平方英寸的电机的仪表被篡改了。他还表示，他认为这台机器是“为了让那些想观看它的人和其他人感到困惑而制造的大而庞大的机器...”，而且“在操作这台引擎时，没有像声称的那样产生或利用真空。”因此，奈特得出结论，基利的乘数器及其附件，包括反应装置，不能产生声称的效果。根据奈特的说法，这种巨大的强度是“完全不必要的，只是用来支撑他们所受的压力，并让见证他实验的人感到惊异和误导。”在他的看法中，基利声称的极高压力没有产生，“在任何情况下都可能没有超过每平方英寸500磅，并且仪表和加权杠杆装置的读数是不正确的。”奈特认为，基利的真空并不是通过吸收或吸收所谓的蒸汽产生的，而是通过机械手段，“例如之前排气的室或其等效物。”奈特认为，基利的蒸汽仅仅是“在实验之间的间隔期间，之前被压缩并存储在设备的各种空心球体和其他室中的大气空气”。

Samples of Keely's vapor were submitted to Charles M. Cresson, a then well known chemist, for a "careful analysis." Cresson's report stated that the vapor was "merely atmospheric air," and that the pressure in the tube was only 225 pounds, instead of the 1,200 pounds that Keely claimed. Keely's reaction as might be expected was one of anger, and the reaction of the stockholders, who by now had expended millions of dollars was one of astonishment. Keely proposed to give "two public exhibitions a week with the motor in an endeavor to demonstrate that it is not a fraud."

将基利的蒸汽样品提交给了当时著名的化学家查尔斯·克雷森进行“仔细分析”。克雷森的报告指出，这种蒸汽仅仅是“大气空气”，而管内的压力只有225磅，而不是基利声称的1,200磅。 基利的反应如预期的那样愤怒，而股东的反应则是惊讶。他提议每周进行“两场公开展示，以试图证明这不是欺诈行为”。

However, these public exhibitions did not do much to clarify things for the skeptics. Two weeks later, a Philadelphia newspaper remarked while publishing a letter by a stockholder of the Keely Motor Company, Oliver M. Babcock that, "...we would have been more gratified if the letter had thrown some light on what is admitted to be the very obscure nature of the moving power of the machine, and the mechanism hrough which it displays a transient force."

然而，这些公开展示并没有对怀疑论者有太多澄清。两周后，一家费城报纸在刊登基利汽车公司股东奥利弗·M·巴布科克的一封信时评论道，“如果这封信能够解释一下机器被承认为非常晦涩的动力来源以及它表现短暂力量的机制，我们会更感到满意。”

Babcock's letter was a defense of Keely against another attack, this time by professors Marks and Barker of the University of Pennsylvania. Just a week before, they had published in the same newspaper a rebuttal of Keely's claims, by stating that the Keely motor according to them worked by, not surprisingly, compressed air in combination with an ordinary hydraulic screw pump, which they saw standing "rusty and dusty in the corner of a remote room of Keely's shop." Babcock wrote: ".. .they can have $ 1,000 if they can, within three months by any means, direct or indirect, fill a twenty pint chamber with air at a pressure of 10,000 lbs." Of the hydraulic screw pump, Babcock had this to say: "...has not been in use since last December. It never was used for compressed air, and could not be so used with success on any considerable volume of air or other substance equally elastic. ...The compressed air theory, especially in connection with the hydraulic screw pump is simply absurd, and does not deserve a moment's notice."

巴布科克的信是为了反驳宾夕法尼亚大学教授马克斯和巴克尔的另一次攻击。就在一周之前，他们在同一家报纸上发表了一篇驳斥基利的声明，声称基利的发动机是通过压缩空气与普通液压螺杆泵相结合工作的，他们还在基利的车间偏远房间的角落里看到了“生锈和灰尘覆盖”的液压螺杆泵。巴布科克写道：“如果他们能够在三个月内通过任何方式，直接或间接地将二十品脱的空气在10000磅的压力下充入，我们将支付1000美元。”关于液压螺杆泵，巴布科克有这样的说法：“自去年十二月以来就没有使用过。它从未被用于压缩空气，无法在任何相当数量的空气或其他同样有弹性的物质上成功使用。压缩空气理论，特别是与液压螺杆泵相结合的理论，是完全荒谬的，不值得一提。”

In 1878, Keely also began conducting several remarkable experiments involving the suspension of gravity, which he called "vibratory lift,"22 and the construction of an instrument with the same name.23 While experimenting with this device, he made his first discovery of the disintegration of mineral substances by means of the new force.

在1878年，基利还开始进行一些关于悬浮重力的引人注目的实验，他称之为“振动升降”，并且制造了一个同名的仪器。在研究这个装置的过程中，他首次发现了利用这个新的力量对矿物物质进行解离的方法。

But while these experiments filled his protagonists and those who claimed to have witnessed these experiments with awe, there were still the skeptical-minded scientists who thought quite different about the whole affair. Still no complete engine was forthcoming, and by 1879 this was to have its effects on the Keely Motor Company, all the more because the stockholders were jeered at by the press and others.

然而，虽然这些实验让一些人感到惊叹，但仍有持怀疑态度的科学家对整个事情持不同看法。仍然没有完整的引擎出现，在1879年，这将对基利电机公司产生影响，尤其是因为股东受到了媒体和其他人的嘲笑。

The company was now on the verge of bankruptcy, and Keely agreed to a scheme that the company proposed. He assigned the rights of two of his inventions, the automatic waterlift and the vapor gun, to the Keely Motor Company. Stock was increased from 20,000 to 100,000 shares. The 80,000 new shares were to be divided equally: 40,000 to pay for the inventions, 20,000 to the treasury of the company, and 20,000 divided among stockholders. Of the 40,000 shares that should have gone to Keely, less than 5,000 reached him. Nearly 34,000 went to compensate fraudulent claims held by three separate persons against him. One of these claims involved the case of a man who, acting as Keely's agent or attorney, disposed of two thirds of the vapor gun and the automatic waterlift, but failed to make the proper returns. The transferee came in for two-thirds of the 40,000 shares set apart to pay for the inventions. A number of shares of less amount went to other persons to whom Keely had made advance sales in order to carry on his work. The appearance of this stock on the market in 1880 broke the prices down to a nominal rate, and it discouraged many stockholders who had obtained their stock by fair purchases.

此时，该公司处于破产的边缘，基利同意了该公司提出的一个方案。他将他的两项发明——自动提水机和蒸汽枪的权利分配给了基利电机公司。股票从20,000股增加到100,000股。增加的80,000股被平均分配：40,000股用于支付发明，20,000股用于公司储备，20,000股分配给股东。应该分配给基利的40,000股中，只有不到5,000股到达了他手中。近34,000股用于赔偿三个分别持有他的诈骗索赔的人。其中一个索赔涉及到一个人的案例，他曾作为基利的代理人或代理人，处理了蒸汽枪和自动提水机的三分之二，但未能做出适当的回报。受让人获得了分配用于支付发明的40,000股的三分之二。其他一些小额股票分配给了基利曾经提前销售以继续工作的其他人。这些股票在1880年出现在市场上，导致价格暴跌，许多通过公正购买股票的股东感到沮丧。

During 1880 there still was not much hope or the prospect of an immediate success of Keely's inventions, and a newspaper even remarked that an office, kept in New York for the Keely motor, was "simply an enterprise for speculations in Keely motor stock—in fact, a stock gambling den."

1880年期间，基利的发明仍没有太多希望或立即成功的前景，一家报纸甚至评论说，为Keely马达保留在纽约的一家办事处是“仅仅是为了在Keely马达股票上进行投机活动，实际上是一个股票赌场”。

Suddenly in March, Keely announced that he would complete his engine in a short period of time, and not only that, he would feature an entire new line of exotic devices. A newspaper noted that the interest of the general public became "somewhat renewed in the Keely motor, caused by the statements of Mr. Keely himself that he will
be ready in about six weeks to put his new vibratory engine to practical use. Instead of the great cumbersome machinery which he had heretofore, there are small, neat looking objects which he calls generators and engines. He claims now to have full control of the vapor which contains such great power, and can do with it as he sees fit. 'About two years ago,' says Mr. Keely, 'I abandoned the idea of applying my vaporic power to the ordinary piston engines, and by accident found that a new engine of a different sort was needed. It is not an invention, and I do not claim to be an inventor, but a discoverer. I am so confident now that I have succeeded, that I will stake all I have in the world on the results to be accomplished within the next three months.'"

三月份，基利突然宣布他将短时间内完成他的发动机，并且还将展示一整个新的异国装置系列。一家报纸指出，由于基利本人的声明，公众对基利发动机的兴趣“有所恢复，他将在约六周内准备好使用他的新振动发动机。用来取代大而笨重的机械，现在出现了小巧玲珑的发电机和引擎。他声称现在完全掌握了含有巨大功率的蒸汽，可以根据自己的意愿使用它。基利说：“大约两年前，我放弃了将我的蒸汽动力应用于普通的活塞发动机的想法，偶然发现需要一种新的、不同种类的发动机。这不是一项发明，我也不声称是发明家，而是发现者。我现在非常自信，已经成功了，我将把自己拥有的所有东西押在未来三个月内完成的结果上。”

Keely's new device, the vibratory engine that he had completed in his workshop, occupied a space of about four feet square. "All the machinery is contained in a cylinder which resembles an ordinary drum. Through this runs a double shaft, one revolving in a sleeve. It is upon this shaft that the difficulty at present exists. The negative and positive motions are nearly equal, and Mr. Keely is engaged in the graduation of these so as to cause them to harmonize. When he accomplishes this, which he says is a tedious operation, then the Keely motor will be completed."

基利在他的车间里完成了他的新装置，振动发动机，占据了大约四英尺见方的空间。 “所有的机器都包含在一个类似于普通鼓的圆筒中。从这里面穿过一根双轴，其中一个在套管中旋转。现在的问题就在于这个轴。正负两个运动几乎相等，基利先生正在调节它们，使它们达到和谐。当他完成这个过程时，他说这是一个繁琐的操作，那么基利发动机将完成。”

A reporter was given the privilege of a demonstration: "Two small keys were turned, and immediately the shaft, containing an 18-inch wheel, began to revolve. There is no flywheel to the engine, only the one to which the pulley is attached direct. This moves at the rate of about 25 revolutions per minute. Mr. Keely claims that this is all that is necessary, as the shafting may be geared to run the machinery to any speed required...The new generator is also a curiosity. It occupies a space of about 6 feet in length, 10 in width, and a height of 5 feet. There are numerous small pipes, of mysterious appearance of the thickness of telegraph wire, bored to the fineness of a cambric needle. One of these leads from the generator to the engine, and it is claimed that all the power is secured through this medium, and the regularly motion secured by the vibratory apparatus contained inside the drum cylinder."

一位记者有幸观看了基利的演示：“转动两个小钥匙，立即激活了一个包含一个18英寸的轮子的轴。发动机没有飞轮，只有直接附在滑轮上的一个轮子。这个轮子每分钟旋转大约25次。基利声称这足以满足需要，因为轴可以齿轮传动机械到任何所需速度...这个新型的发电机也很有意思。它占据了大约6英尺长、10英尺宽和5英尺高的空间。有许多看起来神秘的小管，它们的厚度就像电报线一样，孔径象棉布针一样细。其中一个管道从发电机通向发动机，据说所有的动力都是通过这个管道传输的，而规则的运动是通过鼓状筒内的振动装置获得的。”

Naturally, Keely stated, as he had done on several previous occasions, that he was planning on obtaining a patent. But even then, Keely warned, "it will require at least a year of lecturing to demonstrate the secret of generator and engine. ...The apparatus will be in use some 20 years before the thing is fully understood." The reporter could state that, "There is one thing certain, Mr. Keely has succeeded in making the wheel go around. He has abandoned his idea of pressure. He has got hold of something which he says is the right thing, and has recently been creating some excitement in a private way among scientific men."

基利自然而然地表示，正如之前几次一样，他计划获得一项专利。但即使如此，基利也警告说：“需要至少一年的讲解才能展示发电机和发动机的秘密......在大家完全理解之前，这个装置将使用约20年。”这位记者可以证实：“有一件事是确定的，基利先生成功地使轮子转动。他放弃了压力这个想法。他找到了一些他称之为正确的东西，并最近在科学家之间私下引起了一些激动。”

The members of the Keely Motor Company could only declare, at their annual meeting which was held six months later on December 8th, that Keely had "discovered and developed a new motive power of extraordinary power and energy," and that they had every confidence that he would have "under his entire control" the "mechanical details connected with his engine." Yet the next year was not to fulfill the expectations of the Keely Motor Company, and the interest of the public dissolved once again. A lecture in New York during which the motor was fully described and was illustrated by diagrams "of the most complicated and convincing character," drew no attendants. But it was also noted that "with the innumerable pipes and cocks of the generator, and the imposing simplicity of the engine, one could not help being convinced that the Keely motor is as genuine and satisfactory as the ablest perpetual motion machine ever patented." A scientific journal published the lecture, together with the accompanying diagrams.

凯利电机公司的成员在六个月后的12月8日举行的年度会议上只能宣布，基利“发现并开发了一种非凡的动力和能源”，他们有信心他会“完全控制与他的引擎相关的机械细节。” 然而，接下来的一年并没有达到凯利电机公司的期望，公众的兴趣再次消失。在纽约举行的一场完整描述该电机并用“最复杂和令人信服的图表”进行说明的演讲没有人前来参加。但是其中也指出，“通过发电机的无数管道和阀门，加上引擎的庄重和简单性，无人能够否认凯利电机就像最有能力的永动机一样真实和令人满意。”一份科技期刊发表了该讲座及其附带的图表。

What was Keely doing during these years? The overall picture that emerges is that, apart from the usual demonstrations in his workshop, he was building device after device, destroying and selling these as "old metal" after having constructed newer prototypes while trying to master what he had discovered. "Since the principle of the Keely motor was first discovered," a newspaper wrote at that time, "the inventor has made half a dozen different engines, each one of which has been simpler and better than its predecessors. In its present state the engine contains 'one hundred and fifty pints in a descending vibratory scale.'"

基利在那段时间里在做什么呢？总体上看，除了在他的工作室进行常规演示之外，他一直在建造各种新设备，然后销毁或将其出售为“旧金属”，构建新的原型，试图掌握他所发现的东西。当时一家报纸写道：“自从基利电机的原理被首次发现以来，发明家已经制造了半打不同的发动机，每一款都比它的前身更简单更好。在当下的状态下，它的发动机包含‘一百五十个品脉下降的振动尺度’。”

And in doing so, Keely would invent and introduce a new phraseology for his discovery and certain parts of his devices, unlike anything heard before. In a puzzled state, one was left to muse on terms and parts as "six tuning forks," though five would probably be sufficient, a "compound vitalizing medium," a "vibratory elliptic," a "positive wave plate," a "spiraphone box," together with several "positive and negative tubes," and as many sets of "triple vibratories" as are necessary for transmitting "sympathies."

在这样做的过程中，基利会发明并引入一种新的短语体系，用来描述他的发现和设备的某些部分，与以前听说过的任何东西都不同。在困惑的情况下，人们可以考虑术语和部件，例如“六个音叉”，虽然五个可能就足够了，一个“复合活化介质”，一个“振动椭圆形”，一个“正波板”，一个“旋波盒”，还有几个“正面和负面管”，以及多达必要数量的“三倍振动系统”，用于传输“共鸣”。

And as if this wasn't enough, Keely at one time allegedly stated that he wanted "to add a 'compound deodorized vaporized shaft' to the generator and to enlarge the 'antinomian cylinder' of the engine by prolonging it at the end and inserting in its 'negative casing' a 'monophysite tube,' studded with thirty-six 'sabellian holes,' and terminating in a 'galvanic manichuan chamber.' With these improvements, Keely claimed, he would be able to obtain seven hundred additional revolutions per minute, and to reduce the supply of water needed in the generator to five-sixths of a pint."

似乎这还不够，据说基利曾经表示，他想在发电机上增加一个“复合脱臭蒸汽轴”，并通过将引擎的“违禁圆筒”在末端延长并在其“负面套管”中插入一个“一性论管”，上面镶有三十六个“萨贝利洞口”，并在一个“电化学曼尼切奥室”中结束。基利声称，通过这些改进，他将能够获得额外的七百次转速，并将发电机所需的水量减少到五分之六品脱。

The months rolled on without Keely being able to meet the constant and pressing demands of the Keely Motor Company for a commercially exploitable engine. Instead it seems, he was more devoted to journeying over ever-new distances far beyond the horizons of known science, and following the new trails that his experiments showed him. The limitless possibilities! Who can say now with any certainty what went through his mind and what visions he had at night in the lonely hours in his workshop, with all Philadelphia around him at rest? There are some hints though, of what he must have thought during these years, for Keely later wrote: "There are moments in which I feel that I can measure the very stars, which shine like Edens in planetary space; fit abodes for beings who have made it the study of their lives on earth to create peace and happiness all around them." Sometimes during his experiments, he would suffer accidents; once in a while explosions occurred, "sometimes harmless to him, at other times laying him up for weeks at a time," and it was said that for a decade, Keely made no progress.

随着时间的推移，基利无法满足基利电动机公司对可商业化利用的引擎的持续和紧迫需求。相反，他更加热衷于探索超越已知科学范围的新距离，并按照他的实验结果寻找新的道路。他的实验所显示的无限可能性让人无法估量。谁又能够确定他在这些孤独的工作室中度过的许多夜晚，思考了多少天马行空的想法呢？基利在后来的写作中提到：“有时我感觉自己可以测量天上星辰的距离，它们在行星空间中熠熠闪耀，成为那些致力于在地球上创造和平与幸福的人们的终极目标。” 在实验过程中，他经常遭遇事故，有时会发生爆炸，“有时对他无伤大雅，有时却需要数周时间进行恢复”，据说十年间基利没有取得任何进展。

In 1881, he was in one of the gravest periods of his career. The stock of the Keely Motor Company had fallen very low, and as a consequence, a new exhibition had been deemed necessary. The demonstration would be given in the evening of April 22, in the presence of a large body of businessmen from New York. A few days before, Keely gave a private showing to several other important businessmen; among those present was a major of the United States Ordnance Department, Commander Gorringe of the United States Navy, the vice president of Erie Railway, the commodore of the New York Yacht Club, the president of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and 20 unidentified persons. Gorringe later said: "I am amazed at what I have seen. It is certainly one of the most remarkable curiosities I have ever looked upon, and appears bona fide."

1881年，基利的职业生涯正处于最危急的时刻。基利电机公司的股票已经大幅下跌，因此需要进行新的展示。展示将在4月22日晚上，在纽约一大批商人的面前进行。展示前几天，基利向其他几位重要商人进行了私人展示，当时在场的有美国兵工部的一位少校、美国海军的戈林吉司令、艾利铁路的副总裁、纽约游艇俱乐部的舰队司令、利哈伊山谷铁路的总裁以及其他20个未知人士。戈林吉后来说：“我对自己见到的东西感到惊讶。它无疑是我曾经看过的最为卓越的奇异之物之一，而且看起来是真实的。”

The demonstration of April 22 was attended by an equally impressive list of persons: the city Chamberlain of New York, a representative of the Continental Iron Works, the secretary of the American Wrecking Company, and other, unidentified persons. The demonstration was described as "a very extended one." When the visitors, who almost completely filled the front room of Keely's workshop, had been seated, "they saw before them an odd-looking machine built of steel, that shone like a mirror." A contemporary account described the device in a puzzled tone: ".. .it is wholly unlike any other collection of globes and tubes that has ever been exhibited."

4月22日的展示同样吸引了一批令人印象深刻的人物：纽约市的总会计师、大陆铁厂代表、美国拆船公司的秘书和其他身份未知的人。这次展示被描述为“一次非常广泛的展示”。当访客们坐下后，他们看到了一台由钢铁构成的奇怪机器，它闪闪发光，像一面镜子。当时的报道以疑惑的语气描述了这个装置：“...它完全不像任何其他的球体和管道的组合，这些曾经被展出过。”

The visitors were given ample opportunity to inspect the device. Every cock and tube was removed to show that the apparatus was empty. Lights were placed underneath the engine, and those present were invited to look into and through the various chambers. All the plugs and attachments were replaced, and a member of the group "drew a glass of water from the hydrant" and poured the water into "half a dozen funnel-topped tubes." In "exactly 29 seconds a force was generated sufficient to raise a six-foot lever (one inch fulcrum) upon which were hung 700 pounds of iron." The pressure was asserted to be 15,000 pounds to the square inch. The vapor responsible for this pressure was then stored in a steel cylinder "about thirty inches long and five inches thick," through the center of which was stretched "a piece of piano wire."

参观者有充分的机会检查该装置。每个孔和管都被拆下，以展示设备是空的。灯光被放置在引擎下面，出席者被邀请查看和透过各种腔室。所有插头和附件都被更换，小组中的成员“从消防栓中取了一杯水”，将水倒入“半打漏斗顶部的管子”中。在“29秒钟内，产生了足以提起一个装有700磅铁的6英尺长的杠杆（支点长1英寸）”的力量。压力被声明为每平方英寸15000磅。负责产生这种压力的气体随后被储存在一个“大约30英寸长、5英寸厚”的钢制圆筒中，其中心拉着“一根钢琴线”。

The confined vapor was "vivified" by "external vibrations of great energy," obtained from a tuning fork of immense size. Then a long tube of "very constricted orifice" was attached to the steel cylinder, to form the connection with the engine in the rear room. When the visitors assembled in this room, they saw an engine that Keely called a compound generator. Keely explained this name by telling that "it can be worked with equal effect by positive or negative energy." After he pulled open a few cocks, a spirophone, contained in one of the drums, began "to roar," and the shaft that carried a belt-wheel began to revolve "with great velocity." The sound, a "whirring sound (much resembling the rising of a flock of quail)" gradually became regular and harmonious, and the engine settled down to a regular speed of about sixty revolutions per minute. Keely then made some "curious experiments" to exhibit what was named "vibratory energy." The revolutions of the engine were increased or diminished at will by Keely striking an iron disk or a gigantic tuning fork, or drawing a bow over a tightly stretched steel wire. When Keely changed from the negative to the positive energy, it resulted in an "almost instantaneous reversal of the engine." Keely declared that this reversal could be made "at the very highest velocity without breaking anything."

 被限制的蒸汽被“巨大能量的外部振动”所“活化”，这种能量来自一个巨大的音叉。然后，将一个长长的“非常收窄的开口”的管子连接到钢制圆筒上，以形成与后面房间里的引擎的连接。当参观者聚集在这个房间里时，他们看到了基利称为复合发生器的引擎。基利通过告诉人们“它可以通过正能量或负能量同样有效地工作”来解释这个名字。在他打开一些阀门之后，一个包含在一个鼓中的螺旋音器开始“咆哮”，拖带轮的轴开始以“极高的速度”旋转。这个声音是一个“嗡嗡声（很像一群鹌鹑的上升）”，逐渐变得规律和和谐，引擎稳定在大约每分钟60转的稳定速度上。然后，基利进行了一些“奇特的实验”，展示了所谓的“振动能量”。基利可以通过击打一个铁盘或巨大的音叉，或拉过一个紧绷的钢丝的弓，随意增加或减少引擎的旋转。当基利从负能量转换为正能量时，结果是引擎“几乎瞬间反转”。基利宣称这种反转可以以“最高速度”进行，“而不会破坏任何东西”。

A brake, specially made with wooden lining was then applied to the belt wheel with a leverage of five feet and the weight of two of the heaviest persons of the visiting party, but "no perceptible diminution in the speed resulted." This was not all that the visitors were shown: "many other strange experiments with the vapor gun and other appliances of the alleged invention were given, after which the party separated." The demonstration lasted for three unforgettable hours,37 and one may now only speculate upon the nature of the conversations of the visitors, upon their return on the midnight train to New York.

然后，一个专门制作的木质衬里的刹车被应用到皮带轮上，带有五英尺的杠杆和访客团队中两个最重的人的重量，但是“速度没有明显的减少”。这还不是所有参观者看到的内容：“在蒸汽枪和其他所谓的发明器具上进行了许多其他奇怪的实验，之后，参观队分开了。”展示持续了三个难忘的小时，现在我们只能推测参观者在午夜火车回纽约的途中的谈话内容。

Scientific American, however, noted cynically that the demonstration showed foremost that "the Keely managers still look to the New York men. It was from them that their first treasure was extracted after the original first exhibition; and the new show is doubtless expected to yield another yellow harvest."

“科学美国人”杂志愤世嫉俗地指出，这次演示首先表明，“基利的经理人仍然看重纽约人。从他们那里，他们在最初的展览后得到了第一笔财富；而这次新的演示无疑又期望着收获另一波可观的收益。”

Unfortunately, the year 1881 would bring Keely no yellow harvest. Instead, towards the end of the year he would be on the brink of bankruptcy. He had continued his investigations, and from time to time gave out some new features of his discovery, and the new applications that could be made of it. But Keely had not reached a point where he deemed it safe to apply for patents, so difficulties arose between him and the Keely Motor Company. The company refused to pay his bills, and he was practically abandoned by the company.39 Another effect of these unfortunate developments was that the Keely Motor Company once again came to be regarded as a fraudulent undertaking, Keely as a swindler and his allies as either "disreputable  gamblers in stock or the dupes of his wizard artifices."

很遗憾，1881年对基利来说，没有带来黄金的丰收，相反，这一年的末尾，他陷入了破产的边缘。他继续进行研究，并不时公布他的发现的新特征和它可以被应用的新领域。但基利没有到达他认为可以安全申请专利的地步，因此他和基利电机公司之间出现了困难。公司拒绝支付他的账单，他几乎被公司遗弃。这些不幸的发展的另一个影响是，基利电机公司再次被视为欺诈性企业，基利被视为骗子，他的盟友则被视为“名誉不佳的股票投机者或是他巫术般的诡计的受害者”。

At this critical moment, John H. Lorimer—who was a member of the Board of Directors of the Keely Motor Company—and Babcock came to his aide. Lorimer published a pamphlet40 in which he demonstrated that some of the company's directors were responsible for the existing sordid state of affairs. Already having published his favorable pamphlet on Keely, Babcock started a series of lectures with a similar message as Lorimer's.

在这个关键时刻，肯恩·洛瑞默（John H. Lorimer）和巴布科克（Babcock）前来帮助他。洛瑞默是基利电机公司的董事会成员，他发表了一本小册子，证明该公司的一些董事应对现有的肮脏局面负责。巴布科克已经发表了一本有利于基利的小册子，开始了一系列类似于洛瑞默的演讲。

In this period, Keely was assisted financially by several persons whose names were kept secret at that time. One of these was a Dr. William Pepper, who was the provost of the University of Pennsylvania, of all places. He was deeply interested in Keely's inventions, and at one time he dontated $10,000 to his work.

在那个时期，基利得到了一些人的财政支持，他们的名字被保密了。其中之一是威廉·佩珀博士，他是宾夕法尼亚大学当时的校长。他对基利的发明非常感兴趣，有一次他为基利的工作捐赠了10,000美元。

However generous these gestures were, bankruptcy stayed a constant threat and left the Keely household at the brink of starvation. At times, Keely was in such despair that he destroyed several of his "devices for research which had been the labor of years" in fits of frustration, and had to raise money from the sale of other devices as old iron. By pawning his watch and even by selling his costly scientific instruments, including a valuable microscope, he managed to earn enough money to pay the mechanics and to buy material in order to continue his work.

尽管这些举动非常慷慨，但破产仍然是不断威胁着基利家庭的重要因素，甚至让他们面临饥饿的边缘。有时，基利如此绝望，以至于在沮丧的情绪中摧毁了他的“经过多年研究的研究装置”，甚至不得不以旧铁的形式出售其他装置以筹集资金。通过典当他的手表甚至出售他昂贵的科学仪器，包括一架价值不菲的显微镜，他设法赚到了足够的资金来支付机械工人的工资，并购买材料以继续他的工作。

When bankruptcy and starvation were imminent, Clara Bloomfield-Moore, a wealthy Philadelphia woman, came to his aide. She did this at a time when "...the public seemed to have become incredulous or indifferent, when a paragraph published in 1881-2 caught the eye of the widow of Bloomfield-Moore, the paper manufacturer. It related that the inventor, still working to perfect his apparatus, was on the verge of starvation and despair. Mrs. Moore, in speaking of the incident, said she had just been reading of the suicide of an inventor in New York who had been unsuccessful in getting any one to take an interest in his invention, which after his death was seen to have been a valuable one. Here, she thought, was an opportunity to save another inventor from a like fate. She made inquiries, called to see him, and supplied him with means to go on with his work."

当破产和饥饿迫在眉睫时，克拉拉·布鲁姆菲尔德-穆尔（Clara Bloomfield-Moore），一位富有的费城女士，在1881-2年看到一篇报道说基利仍在努力完善他的发明，但即将饿死和绝望。当时公众对他的发明产生怀疑或漠不关心。穆尔夫人在谈到这个事件时说，她刚刚读到纽约一位发明家的自杀新闻，他未能让任何人对他的发明产生兴趣，在他死后，这个发明被认为是有价值的。她认为这是挽救另一个发明家避免同样命运的机会。她进行了调查，拜访了基利，并为他提供了继续工作的资金。

What caught her eye was Babcock's pamphlet on Keely that he privately published in Philadelphia in 1881.45 Bloomfield-Moore would later write that Keely always spoke of that winter of 1881-1882 as "the darkest period of his life. " She found "his wife's roof mortgaged over her head" and Keely somberly pondering over the possibility of committing suicide. She took $10,000, with which she was originally planning to found a small public library, and gave this to Keely. He took half of the amount; more he would not need, he said.

布鲁姆菲尔德-穆尔注意到了巴布科克在1881年私下在费城出版的有关基利的小册子。后来，布鲁姆菲尔德-穆尔写道，基利总是将1881-1882年的那个冬天视为他生命中最黑暗的时期。她发现他的妻子的住所被抵押，基利陷入了沉思，深陷自杀的可能性。她拿出了原本打算用于创办小型公共图书馆的1万美元并将其捐给了基利。他只拿了其中的一半，他表示他不需要更多的资金。

She would finance his experiments and research for almost 15 years, and already being a prolific writer, she would also write a number of articles about Keely and his work.

布鲁姆菲尔德-穆尔将近15年资助了基利的实验和研究，并且她本就是一位多产作家，还写了一些关于基利及其工作的文章。

Things seemed to have turned for the better, but then something unexpected happened.

事情似乎正在好转，但随后发生了一些意想不到的事情。

Within the year, Keely announced a new discovery: the vibratory force of which the demonstration of April 22 was an example. In the meantime, Bloom-field-Moore had become a convert to his theories and revived the hopes of the Keely Motor stockholders. But Keely understood that the company had no interest in his new discoveries.49 For the 10 years before 1882, Keely had limited his demonstrations to the liberation, at will, of the energy he had accidentally discovered while experimenting on vibrations in 1872. The ensuing years he tried to  construct what was termed "the perfect engine" that he had promised the Keely Motor Company. According to Bloomfield-Moore, Keely "made the mistake of pursuing his researches on the line of invention instead of discovery. All his thoughts were concentrated in this direction up to the year 1882."

不久之后，基利宣布了一个新发现：振动力，4月22日的演示就是一个例子。与此同时，布鲁姆菲尔德-摩尔已经成为了他的理论信徒，并重燃了基利马达公司股东的希望。但是，基利意识到公司对他的新发现没有兴趣。在1882年之前的10年，基利将演示局限于他在1872年偶然发现的能量的自由释放。接下来的几年，他试图建造所谓的“完美引擎”，这是他向基利马达公司承诺的。根据布鲁姆菲尔德-摩尔的说法，基利“犯了一个错误，沿着发明而不是发现的方向进行了研究。直到1882年，他所有的想法都集中在这个方向上。”

So in 1882, the Keely Motor Company brought suit against the inventor. Relations between Keely and the company officials were already strained because of his constant refusal or inability to obtain patent papers on his former discovery, the construction of a commercially successful device, and of the rift between him and the company a year before. But the reason for the Keely Motor Company to take him to court was of course Keely's announcement that he had abandoned his disintegration research and instead concentrated on vibratory energy, the new and different technology to which, Keely claimed, the Keely Motor Company had no rights or interest whatsoever.

因此，1882年，基利马达公司对这位发明家提起了诉讼。由于基利不断拒绝或无法获得有关他以前的发现、建造一个商业上成功的设备以及他与公司之间的裂痕，基利和公司官员之间的关系已经紧张。但是，基利马达公司起诉他的原因当然是基利宣布他已经放弃了分解研究，转而集中精力研究振动能量，这是一种新的、不同的技术，基利声称，基利马达公司没有任何权利或利益。

About this new line of research, Bloomfield-Moore wrote, "the two forms of force which he has been experimenting with, and the phenomena attending them, are the very antithesis of each other. " The genesis of this line of research may perhaps be traced back five years earlier; around 1875, Keely developed the notion that he would need a "new engine of a different sort." 

关于这一新研究方向，布鲁姆菲尔德-摩尔写道，“他一直在进行实验的这两种力量形式以及与它们相关的现象是彼此的完全对立。”这一研究方向的起源可以追溯到五年前，大约在1875年，基利就形成了这样的观念，他需要一种“不同种类的新型发动机”。

The Keely Motor Company tried to learn what the differences were between the two devices and what the nature of the secret was that they possessed. This situation brought on the suit against Keely by the Keely Motor Company. He was ordered by the court to explain his secret, which he absolutely refused to do. He claimed that to divulge any information would be to give away his secret, so the court ordered him to be committed to prison until he complied with the order. Bloomfield-Moore stated that"... had Keely obeyed the order of the court in 1882, and made his marvelous secret public, it would have collapsed."

基利发动机公司试图了解这两个设备之间的差异以及它们所拥有的秘密的本质。这种情况引发了基利发动机公司对基利的诉讼。法院命令他解释他的秘密，但他坚决拒绝了。他声称透露任何信息都会泄露他的秘密，因此法院命令他被送进监狱，直到他遵守这个命令。布鲁姆菲尔德-摩尔说：“如果基利在1882年遵循法院的命令，公开他的神奇秘密，那么它就会崩溃。”

It was claimed that it was she who arranged a compromise. An eminent engineer was sworn to secrecy before interviewing Keely. What was said during that interrogation is unknown, but apparently Keely was able to convince the engineer by explaining the differences between the two devices. The engineer's report, while never disclosing the secrets of the devices, seems to have been satisfactory to both the judge and the Keely Motor Company, for the suit was dismissed.

基利发动机公司声称是她安排了一项妥协。在采访基利之前，一位杰出的工程师宣誓保密。虽然在审问期间说了什么尚不得知，但显然基利成功地通过解释两个设备之间的差异说服了工程师。尽管该工程师的报告从未透露设备的秘密，但似乎对法官和基利发动机公司都是令人满意的，因此该诉讼被驳回。

More details of this sad period in Keely's career were written down by Charles Fort, stating that the Keely Motor Company kept its faith until December 1882, when: "there was a meeting of disappointed stockholders of the Keely Motor Co. In the midst of protests and accusations, Keely announced that, though he would not publicly
divulge the secret of his motor, he would tell everything to any representative of the dissatisfied ones. A stockholder named Boekel was agreed upon. Boekel's report was that it would be improper to describe the principle of the mechanism, but that 'Mr. Keely had discovered all that he had claimed.' There is no way of inquiring how Mr. Boekel was convinced. Considering the billions of human beings who have been 'convinced' by words and phrases beyond their comprehension, I think that Mr. Boekel was reduced to a state of mental helplessness by flows of a hydro-pneumatic-pulsating vacuo terminology; and that faithfully he kept his promise not to explain, because he had not more than the slightest comprehension of what it was that had convinced him."

更多关于基利职业生涯中这段悲惨时期的细节被Charles Fort记录下来，他称基利发动机公司一直坚持信念，直到1882年12月，当时“有一群失望的股东召开了会议。在抗议和指责声中，基利宣布尽管他不会公开透露发动机的秘密，但是会向任何不满的人代表透露一切。共同商定由股东Boekel来代表，Boekel的报告是描述这个机制原理是不恰当的，但基利先生确实发现了他所声称的一切。”无法查询Boekel先生被如何说服的。既然有数十亿人被超出他们理解范围的言词和短语“说服”，因此我认为Boekel先生可能会因有关流体动力学和脉动真空术语而陷入精神无助的状态，但他忠实地遵守了自己不要解释的承诺，因为他对所说的内容几乎没有任何理解。

The story uncovered from contemporary newspapers paints a different picture; in fact, the stockholders had lost their patience with, and trust in the inventor several months earlier.

由当时的报纸报道揭示的故事展现了一个不同的情景；事实上，股东们在几个月前就已经失去了对发明家的耐心和信任。

Keely's invention was far from complete, and there was no immediate prospect of it being finished anytime soon. There were still no patents, and worse, only Keely seemed to understand the workings of his devices. He was "still groping for the evasive contrivance that will set everything working according to the original expectation." While the stockholders would have preferred that he do just that, Keely's mind was "scattered over so many inventions that this one cannot receive his constant attention." So the stockholders demanded that he apply for a patent, or at least "explain his invention to some other person," because in case he died, "all the beautiful machinery required in his experiments, and the well engraved certificates of stock will be turned into old iron and waste paper." And, what if Keely would become insane? "Mr. Keely's labors may be too much for him. His friends are afraid he will go crazy, and this would be just as bad for his backers as his death."

基利的发明离完工还有很长的路要走，也没有望近期内完成的迹象。还没有专利，更糟糕的是，只有基利自己似乎理解他的设备是如何工作的。他仍在“苦苦寻找那个神秘的构造，能够按照最初的期望使一切运转起来。”虽然股东们希望他能尽快完成设备，但基利却“心神散乱，想法较多，这个发明无法得到他持续的关注。”于是，股东要求他申请专利，或者至少“向其他人解释他的发明”，因为万一他去世，“他的实验所需的精美机器和股票证书可能就会变成废铁或废纸。”而且，如果基利变得精神失常怎么办？“基利先生的工作可能超过他的负荷极限，他的朋友担心他会精神失常，这对他的支持者来说与他去世一样糟糕。”

On January 20, "John Keely filed a demurrer to the bill in equity presented against him by the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company. The demurrer is entirely technical and gives a number of reasons why the court should not afford the plaintiffs the relief they seek."

1月20日，“约翰·基利对基利电机公司股东向他提出的权益法案提出抗辩书。抗辩书完全是技术性的，提出了许多理由，说明法院不应该提供原告所寻求的救济。”

Keely's legal troubles were far from over: In Philadelphia, on the morning of March 27, in the Court of Common Pleas No. 1, "argument was heard upon a demurrer by Jonathan Puzy, representing John W. Keely, to the bill in equity recently filed by the Keely Motor Company to compel Keely to divulge the secret of his motor. It was argued on behalf of the demurrer that the inventor could not be made to expose that which no one know but himself and which was hidden in his own brain." But on April 1, Judge Pierce overruled Keely's demurrer and ordered him "to make known his process in the way indicated in the bill filed by the Keely Motor Company. This is to compel him to divulge his secret of the motor."

基利的法律问题远未结束：在费城市第一普通陪审法庭，于三月二十七日上午进行听证，由代表约翰·W·基利的乔纳森·普兹提请反驳Keely Motor Company最近提交的权益诉讼，要求基利揭露他的发动机的秘密。抗辩书中主张，发明者不能被强制揭露他自己知道并藏在自己大脑中的秘密。但是，四月一日，法官皮尔斯驳回了基利的抗辩书，并下令他按照Keely Motor Company提交的权益诉讼的要求公开他的过程，强迫他透露发动机的秘密。

Keely's reply came on the 24th of May: "The answer, which is sworn to, substantially admits the truth of the formal portion of the complainant's bill concerning the contract, & Keely adds that, although owing to certain abstruse difficulties by reason of the nature and qualities of the said force, he has thus far failed in his efforts to bring the said inventions and discoveries into any practicable use or to arrive at the utility required by the law, he believes he will ultimately succeed."

基利的回复于五月二十四日到来：“这份回复是经过宣誓的，实质上承认原告的诉讼中关于合同的正式部分是真实的，基利补充说，尽管由于该力量的性质和特性的某些晦涩难懂的困难，他到目前为止仍未成功将这些发明和发现应用于任何实用的用途，也未能达到法律所要求的实用性，但他相信最终会成功。”

In his defense, George H. Peabody, a stockholder of the Keely Motor Company, wrote that, "...The suit on the part of the directors and stockholders is not merely to compel Mr. Keely to give what exists in his mind only, but to give the company the present finished generator and the 'Secret' of working it, as he has done over 7,000 times during the last two years in the presence of hundreds of able men who have no doubt of its great value to day..." The letter also repeated the more sinister motive for the suit: "This is asked for so that the company may understand the power in case of Mr. Keely's death."

基利汽车公司的股东乔治·H·皮博迪出于维护基利的立场，写道：“......董事会和股东提出的诉讼不仅仅是为了迫使基利提供他脑海中存在的东西，而是要基利提供现成的发电机以及操作它的‘秘密’，就像过去两年中他在数百位有能力的人面前已经做了七千多次。这些人毫不怀疑它在今天的价值。”该信还重申了更阴险的起诉动机：“这是为了让公司在基利去世的情况下了解这种力量。”

On June 7, at a meeting of the committee that was appointed by the Board of Directors, an attempt was made to overcome the rift between Keely and certain stockholders. An agreement was signed by both President Randall of the company and Keely, which was then publicized: "...differences have been adjusted, and William Boekel, of Philadelphia, is agreed upon as the person to be instructed by Mr. Keely in the construction and operation of his inventions."64 The honor of learning Keely's secret was bestowed upon Boekel, who was by all means a logical choice. Boekel devoted his life to "mechanical pursuits," and he knew Keely well before the legendary beginning on November 10, 1874. He stated that he was "intimately acquainted" with Keely and his inventions.

6月7日，在董事会任命的委员会会议上，试图克服基利和某些股东之间的裂痕。该公司总裁兰德尔和基利签署了一份协议，随后公开了：......已经解决了分歧，威廉·布克尔被认为是指导基利构建和运营他的发明的人。”布克尔被赋予了学习基利秘密的荣誉，他无疑是一个合理的选择。布克尔将他的一生都献给了“机械追求”，并且在1874年11月10日的传说开始之前就已经很了解基利了。他表示自己“亲密地”了解基利和他的发明。

So what became of Boekel's interrogation? It is suggested that Bloomfield-Moore was instrumental in forging the compromise even though contemporary sources never mention her, and while Fort, by absence of a reference to a time period, suggests that the interview by Boekel was quickly, and more or less satisfactorily done, quite the opposite seems to have taken place.

 那么布克尔的审问最终怎样了呢？据暗示，布鲁姆菲尔德-摩尔在达成妥协方面起了关键作用，尽管当代文献从未提及她，而且Fort由于没有时间限定的参考，暗示布克尔的访谈很快地、或多或少地令人满意，但实际情况恰恰相反。

The answer came several months later; "Mr. William Boekel, the Philadelphia machinist who was selected by Mr. Keely as a proper person to study his mysterious motor and satisfy the doubts of the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company, has been pursuing his studies now for about three months without learning anything  tangible in regard to the wonderful engine. ...As the weeks have passed and Boekel has learned nothing that he did not know before, the stockholders are again becoming suspicious...as Boekel had been employed to manufacture certain parts of the marvelous machine, some of the stockholders objected to him from the first, and declared that his selection was prearranged. Meanwhile, Boekel visits Keely's factory daily, and the people dwelling in the neighborhood are frequently startled by the sounds of terrific explosions in the building. The enemies of the inventor say that he explodes large quantities of gunpowder there for the sake of the effect, and they have determined, if Boekel has not told them something to satisfy them by Tuesday of next week, that they will console themselves with a monster mass-meeting for the purpose of expressing indignation." In a lighter vein, it was added that "Mr. Keely, however, does not appear to be alarmed, and complacently spends time with his new trotting horse over the drives in Fairmount Park on pleasant afternoons."

几个月后，答案揭晓：“费城机械师威廉·布克尔先生被基利先生选为研究他神秘发动机并满足基利汽车公司股东疑虑的合适人选，现在已经进行了大约三个月的研究，却没有学到任何有关这个奇妙的引擎的具体知识……随着周数的增加，布克尔除了之前所知道的，没有学到任何新知识，股东们再次开始产生怀疑……由于布克尔被雇来制造神奇的机器的某些部件，一些股东从一开始就反对他，并宣称他的选择是预先安排的。与此同时，布克尔每天都会去拜访基利的工厂，住在附近的人们经常被惊人的爆炸声所震惊。发明家的敌人说他在那里引爆了大量的火药以达到效果，如果到下周二布克尔没有告诉他们什么话来满足他们，他们就决定组织一次巨大的群众集会，以表达愤慨。”更轻松的是，还补充说：“基利先生似乎并没有感到担忧，在阳光明媚的下午与他的新短跑马匹一起在费尔蒙特公园里散步。”

Then, on December 13, at the annual meeting of the stockholders, Boekel's report was finally presented, supplemented by another report from Keely. His report stated that his engine would soon be completed and in full operation, and that it was his purpose "to bring the matter to the attention of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company with a view of having the engine first applied on their road between Philadelphia and New York."

然后，在12月13日股东年会上，布克尔的报告最终被提交，同时另一份基利的报告也被提交。他的报告称，他的发动机将很快完成并达到全面运转，他的目的是“将此事引起宾夕法尼亚铁路公司的注意，并希望将该发动机首先应用于费城和纽约之间的铁路上。”

Keely assured the stockholders that "he has passed the line of experiment and nothing is left to be done but the completion of the mechanical work now being done on his engine." Once again, there was talk of patents; Keely said in conclusion that, "At your request and with the aid of Mr. Boekel and of counsel I have prepared a caveat for my generator, which has been forwarded to the patent office."

基利向股东们保证，“他已经超越了实验的阶段，现在所需完成的只是在他的发动机上正在进行的机械工作。”再一次谈论到专利问题；基利在报告的结尾说，“在您们的要求和Boekel先生以及顾问的帮助下，我已经为我的发电机准备了一个保留权通知书，并已将其提交到专利局。”

Boekel presented his report; he painted the great possibilities of the natural forces, which, he said, Keely had been "assiduously studying until the inventor's investigations and experiments have carried him far beyond the laboratory experiments of such men as Prof. Tyndall and other scientific investigators." Keely had also succeeded in "exciting, harnessing and utilizing the subtle force which to them has been only a subject of scientific wonder." Boekel then went on to explain that what Keely claimed to have discovered, was "the fact that water in its natural state is capable of being, by vibratory action, disintegrated, so that its molecular structure is broken up, and there is evolved therefrom a permanent expansive gas or ether, which result is produced by mechanical action."

Boekel提交了他的报告，描述了自然力量的巨大潜力，他说Keely一直在“勤奋地研究，直到这位发明家的研究和实验使他远远超越了像蒂恩达尔教授和其他科学研究者这样的人的实验室实验”。Keely成功地“激发、驾驭和利用了他们只是科学奇观的微妙力量。”然后，Boekel解释说，Keely声称发现的是“水在其自然状态下能够通过振动作用分解，使其分子结构破裂，从而产生永久膨胀的气体或以太，这种结果是由机械作用产生的”。

Unfortunately Boekel's report did not describe the mechanism that was used, as it would be "improper." He concluded his report by stating that Keely had "discovered all that he has claimed, and that the stockholders should abide in patience the success of the enterprise." Boekel also added that it had taken so long to perfect his invention,  because although he built "three engines at different times, each being an improvement on its predecessor, but none of them equal to a fair test." But now, Keely was engaged in the construction of a vibratory engine that would deliver 500 horsepower.

Machine: 不幸的是，Boekel的报告没有描述使用的机制，因为这将是“不当的”。他在报告中总结，基利“发现了他所声称的一切，股东们应该耐心等待企业的成功”。Boekel还补充说，这个发明需要很长时间来完善，因为虽然他建造了“三台不同时期的发动机，每一台的改进都比前一台更好，但没有一台能够通过公正测试。”但现在，基利正在建造一台振动发动机，它将提供500马力。

The construction of this engine would take longer than expected; halfway through 1883, word was out that he had completed his vibratory engine that would deliver an awesome amount of horsepower. "For several days past it has been rumored on the street that the much-talked about inventor, Keely of motor fame, has not only really completed his well-known and yet little-known invention, but has completed a wonderful new vibratory engine."

这个发动机的建造需要比预期更长的时间；到1883年中期，有消息称他已经完成了一台能够提供巨大马力的振动发动机。“过去几天，街上一直传闻这位备受瞩目的发明家、著名的机械师基利不仅真正完成了众所周知但鲜为人知的发明，而且完成了一款令人惊叹的新型振动发动机。”

This new engine was giant-sized, but would deliver less than the promised 500 horsepower: "...and now Mr. Keely is completing a mammoth 'vibratory' engine which, he says, will develop at least 300 horsepower. It is rapidly approaching completion...by the end of the present month of July, or early in August, it will be complete. On its completion he will publicly exhibit it first at his workshop, testing its power with a dynamometer, and afterward at another location." Keely was also planning, according to Collier, to give an exhibition or a series of exhibitions that month "of most interesting character in vibratory mechanism."

这个新的发动机是巨型的，但提供的马力不到承诺的500马力：“…现在基利先生正在完成一台庞大的'振动'发动机，他表示这将至少会产生300马力。它正在快速接近完成……在这个7月份结束，或早在8月份，它将完成。完成后，他将首次在他的车间公开展示它，并使用动力计测试它的功率，然后再在另一个位置展示它。” 根据Collier的说法，基利还计划在那个月举办“最有趣的振动机械展览或一系列展览”。

August came, and at a regular monthly meeting of the directors of the Keely Motor Company at the offices of the corporation on Walnut Street, the "monster engine was officially declared to be finished, and it was also declared that it would be ready for operation about the first week of September. It was announced that a final inspection of the machine by the trustees would be made tomorrow forenoon, at which the stockholders were invited to be present."

 8月份到来了，在基利马达公司董事们每月的例会上，他们在公司位于Walnut Street的办公室宣布“巨型引擎已正式完成，并宣布它将在9月的第一周左右准备好运行。宣布了机器的最终检查将在明天上午进行，邀请股东参加。”

Optimism reigned; Treasurer Green proclaimed that he was "exceedingly hopeful, and declared that the day of Keely's vindication was close at hand."

乐观的情绪笼罩着会议;财务主管格林宣称他“非常有希望，并宣布基利得到伸张正义的日子已经非常接近了。”

In this high-spirited and triumphant atmosphere, it was almost overlooked that poor Boekel "had not yet been introduced to the mysteries of the motor by Mr. Keely; that the inventor kept delaying matters by telling the expert that he could explain to him the curious mechanism after its completion in less than two hours. This he had not done yet, because the engine had not reached that final and highly desirable stage." The rumor that Keely had completed his engine reverberated throughout the country: "Applications for passage on the first Keely train for New York have already begun to  pour in from all parts of the country. "

在这种兴高采烈和胜利的气氛中，人们几乎忽略了可怜的博克尔“尚未被基利先生介绍过机器的奥秘；发明家一直告诉专家，他可以在不到两个小时的时间内在机器完成后向他解释这个奇怪的机制。但是，因为发动机还没有达到最终和非常理想的阶段，他还没有这样做。”有关基利已经完成了他的发动机的传言在全国范围内传开：“来自全国各地的人们已经开始申请乘坐第一班前往纽约的基利磁浮列车。”

The inspection came on August 29, but it would be a big disappointment. In the presence of the directors of the Keely Motor Company, headed by President Randall, Keely "played a tune on the vibrator, and remarked that it was quite ridiculous to expect any experiments on the big engine yet... One of the visitors, who has promised a number of friends a ride to New York on September 1 looked grieved, whereupon Mr. Keely called attention to the fine appearance which the black and white lining of the shell would be presented after it had been enameled." The response by the unfortunate visitor was unfortunately lost in history.

检查于8月29日进行，但结果非常令人失望。在基利发动机公司的董事会成员在兰德尔总裁的带领下的见证下，基利“在振动器上演奏了一首曲子，并表示现在期望在大发动机上进行任何实验是非常荒谬的……其中一名游客许诺了一些朋友在9月1日前往纽约，看起来很失望，于是基利先生指出，经过涂漆之后，壳体的黑白内衬会呈现出优美的外观。”不幸的游客的回应不幸地丢失在历史中。

Amidst the disturbance, a spontaneous search of Keely's workshop began: "The  directors then went upstairs and examined the wreckage of the 12 smaller engines used in past experiments. They concluded that the remains of the $5,000 one closely resembled the fragments of the $70,000 one downstairs. Then Mr. Keely and Mr. Becker, the foreman, went through a brief dialogue. 'You've worked for me 14 years, haven't you?' said Mr. Keely. 'More than 14, I guess' said Mr. Becker. 'And how much do you know about running the motor?' said the inventor. 'Nothing,' replied the foreman. 'If I did I wouldn't be here wearing a dirty shirt.' Afterward, Mr. Keely made some astute remarks about a 30 lb. vacuum, and Mr. Becker said that the stock would begin to rise again within a week. He refused, in a mysterious manner, to tell the reason of the expected 'boom.' The foreman then distributed among the visitors the card of a Walnut Street broker, of whom the company's stock could be bought, and the performance closed."

在混乱中，人们开始自发地搜查基利的车间：“接着，董事们上楼检查了过去实验所用的12个较小发动机的残骸。他们得出结论，价值5000美元的发动机的残骸与楼下价值70,000美元的发动机的碎片非常相似。然后基利先生和领班贝克尔进行了一个简短的对话。“你已经为我工作了14年，是吗？”基利先生问。“我想超过14年了，”领班回答说。“你对驱动发动机有多少了解？”发明家问道。“一无所知，”领班回答说。“如果我知道，我不会穿着脏衬衫在这里。”之后，基利先生对30磅的真空做了些精明的评论，贝克尔先生说，股票将在一周内开始上涨。他以神秘的方式拒绝透露预期“繁荣”的原因。然后，领班在游客中分发了一张核桃街经纪人的名片，可以在那里购买公司的股票，演出结束了。

The bizarre meeting with the unusual anticlimax stirred the smoldering resentment that still lingered in the Keely Motor Company. Two months later, on October 29, they were "up in arms again and are preparing for another suit against the inventor." This time, the complaints came from Keely's former friends, and the suit was to be brought "in the name of the company against Keely for the fulfillment of his many pledges." 

在这场怪异的会议后，令人意外的结局激起了基利汽车公司仍然存在的愤怒。两个月后的10月29日，他们“再次举起武器，准备对发明家提起另一起诉讼。”这一次，抱怨声来自基利的前朋友，诉讼是“以公司的名义对基利提起的，要求履行他的许多承诺。”

Yet that night, at a meeting of the Board of the Directors, Keely made a "statement explaining his progress, and stating that he was constructing a street chamber to contain the vapor, and that when this was completed an exhibition would be given. The directors voted Mr. Keely's explanation very satisfactory. And when the Keely Motor Company held a meeting on December 12, Keely was granted more time to complete his invention. It was also remarked that he 'had met with great obstacles, both mechanic and domestic' For a year Mrs. Keely has been ill, her death occurring about one month ago."

然而，在董事会的一次会议上，基利做了一份“解释他的进展的声明，并声明他正在建造一个街道室来容纳蒸汽，当这个完成时将有一个展览。”董事们投票认为基利先生的解释非常令人满意。当基利汽车公司于12月12日召开会议时，基利被授予更多时间来完成他的发明。还有人指出，他“遇到了很多机械和家庭方面的困难”，基利的妻子已经病了一年，大约一个月前去世了。

The year 1884 was to become another trouble-ridden year for John Keely. Unknown to him, in the same year a lean Yugoslavian immigrant arrived in New York with just a few dollars, a booklet with his poetry, some designs for a futuristic aircraft and an introduction letter to Thomas Alva Edison. His name was Nikola Tesla, and in
the years to come, this genius would encounter several problems, not unlike those that Keely had to deal with. And in the end, Tesla would have something to say about Keely as well.

在人类历史的角度：1884年对约翰·基利来说，又是一个充满麻烦的年份。 他并不知道，在同一年里，一位名叫尼古拉·特斯拉的瘦削的南斯拉夫移民到纽约，只带着几美元、一本他的诗集、一些未来飞行器的设计和一封介绍信给托马斯·爱迪生。在未来的几年里，这位天才将遇到一些问题，与基利所面临的问题不尽相同。最终，特斯拉也会对基利有所评价。

Meanwhile, new setbacks occurred. All the employees at Keely's workshop were fired, including the head mechanic, Albert Chance, who had worked on the motor for seven years. This measure was taken, Secretary Schuellerman explained to the reporter, "because their work has been accomplished and we have no further use for them. Today Mr. Keely will begin focalizing and adjusting the vibrators. He will henceforth operate entirely alone. This work of adjustment may take several days. A perfect adjustment of  all the parts is necessary. This is a delicate operation, but for Mr. Keely it is not a difficult one, and as soon as he obtains one revolution, be it ever so slow, his task practically is finished." High spirited, like the optimism that had lived so shortly the year before, Schuellerman added: "I see no reason why we may not expect to hear almost any day now that the engine is running."

与此同时，出现了新的挫折。基利的车间所有员工均被解雇，包括曾经在发动机上工作了七年的首席机械师阿尔伯特·钱斯。秘书舒勒曼向记者解释说，“因为他们的工作已经完成了，我们不再需要他们。今天基利先生将开始调节振动装置。他将将来完全独自操作。这项调整工作可能需要几天时间。需要对所有部件进行完美的调整。这是一个微妙的操作，但对于基利先生来说并不困难，一旦他得到一次转动，即使速度再慢，他的任务基本上就完成了。”像前一年那样充满干劲的乐观主义者舒勒曼补充说：“我认为我们现在完全有理由期待任何一天都有消息称发动机运行了。”

And so, at the meeting of the Keely Motor Company held on March 25, the directors who left Schuellerman's office that evening were to the outside world, a very "hopeful-looking body of men." They had good reason. "The vibratory engine is finished," they said; "the work of adjusting and focalizing is progressing rapidly, and Mr. Keely has fixed the date for the actual exhibition of the motor on or before April 10." Keely himself was not present at the meeting. He told treasurer Green that "I am now so near done with my work that I don't want to appear before the directors again until I appear to exhibit to them in our final triumph." Green also read a statement by Keely, in which he was denying that he was delaying the completion of the motor in order to "apply his mysterious power to other mediums in the interest of other parties."

因此，在3月25日召开的基利电机公司会议上，当晚离开舒勒曼办公室的董事们对外界展现出了一种充满希望的气氛。他们有足够的理由：“振动发动机已经完成，”他们说，“调整和聚焦的工作正在快速进展中，基利先生已经确定了在4月10日或之前展示电机的日期。”基利本人没有出席会议。他告诉财务主管格林：“我现在近乎完成我的工作，我不想再出现在董事会面前，直到我在我们的最终胜利中向他们展示为止。”格林还宣读了基利的一份声明，他在声明中否认了拖延电机完成的指责，并称自己没有将“神秘的能量”应用于其他利益方面。

However, around this time, when Keely once again was asked when he would patent his engine, he answered that, "I do not know how near success may be, nor yet how far off it is."

然而，就在这个时候，当基利再次被问及何时申请发动机专利时，他回答道：“我不知道成功离我有多近，也不知道有多远。”

September—and almost a decade after the first demonstration that had gained him his reputation—Keely would find himself for the first time giving a demonstration elsewhere than in his workshop, and with a new device called a "vaporic gun," with which he had given occasional demonstrations in his workshop as early as 1881. Until September 1884, all of Keely's demonstrations had taken place in his workshop. This was a severe point of criticism, since scoffers and skeptics doubted that his devices would work anywhere else. The Keely Motor Company had finally succeeded in arranging a demonstration at another location. The demonstration was an initiative of a Col. John Hamilton and Captain Van Reed, who had invested in Keely's inventions and who had visited him in Philadelphia, accompanied by A.R. Edey, at that time president of the Keely Motor Company.

九月，距离他第一次展示自己的成果已经过去了将近十年，基利第一次在工作室之外展示自己的成果，使用了一种名为“蒸汽枪”的新装置，在他的工作室中，他已经在1881年进行过一些偶尔的演示。直到1884年9月，基利的所有演示都在他的工作室里进行。这是一个严重的批评点，因为嘲笑者和怀疑者怀疑他的装置在其他地方是否能够工作。基利电机公司最终成功地安排了在另一个地方的演示。这一演示由约翰·汉密尔顿上校和范·里德船长发起，他们投资于基利的发明，并在费城拜访他时得到了阿尔·伊迪的陪同，当时他是基利电机公司的总裁。

The demonstration was given on September 20 at a government range at Fort Lafayette76 at Sandy Hook. Keely arrived there by a special car, placed at his disposal by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad.77 This car was needed because Keely expressed grave doubts about transporting via the railroad the two containers with the etheric gas on which the gun worked, since the effect that would be produced upon the vapor by the sound of an express train were uncertain. Nevertheless, they arrived safely at the range. Around 300 people, among them representatives of Scientific American and government officials, were present to witness his demonstrations with the "vaporic gun," sometimes also called "pneumatic gun," or "etheric force gun."

这次演示是在9月20日在桑迪胡克的拉斐特堡政府范围内举行的。基利乘坐费城和雷丁铁路公司提供的专用车到达那里。基利表示对通过铁路运输两个装有以太气体的容器很怀疑，因为不清楚高速列车的声音会对气体产生什么影响。因此，这辆车是必需的。最终，这些装置还是安全地到达了范围内。大约有300人在现场观看了他使用“蒸汽枪”进行的展示，有时也被称为“气动枪”或“以太力枪”，其中包括《科学美国人》杂志的代表和政府官员。

Keely and his helpers also brought a small cannon to the area, the "vaporic gun," that worked, according to Keely, on this etheric gas. A lead bullet with a diameter of an inch was placed into the cannon, and Keely then obtained the force from the containers through a "flexible copper tube," attaching one end of it to the breech of the gun.

基利和他的助手还把一门小型大炮带到了现场，这门枪被称为“蒸汽枪”，据基利称它是用这种以太气体工作的。他们把一颗直径为1英寸的铅弹放入炮管，然后基利通过一根“柔性铜管”，将其一端连接到炮膛，从容器中获取力量。

The force was derived from an etheric vapor produced by his generator. The first chamber of the generator was filled with air that was "stimulated by vibrations" to  "create a small disturbance." This was done by dropping water into it. When the air then reached the second chamber it would come in contact with the vibratory ether, which would "act upon the water and the air in such a way as to separate the particles  of water and air.  Expansion follows, and the force thus generated is irresistible."

这种力量来自于他的发电机产生的以太气体。发电机的第一个室内充满由震动刺激的空气，以“创建一个小的扰动”。这是通过向其中滴水来完成的。当空气进入第二个室时，它会接触到振动的以太，这会“以一种使水和空气的粒子分离的方式作用于水和空气。接下来是膨胀，从而产生的力量是不可抗拒的。”

The gun had a spherical knob, secured to the breech, from which projected a round vibrator bar having a diameter about equal to that at the extremity of the muzzle. The breech was 4.5 inches in diameter and its length 3.5 feet. The biggest of two containers, made of wrought iron, that held this force, or vapor, was opened, but "nothing could be obtained from it." This had happened before the guests arrived. Keely feared that the vapor had become "negatized," so he "administered blows carefully" between the big and the little container. To this end, Keely used a wooden mallet. A stroke upon the small container "intensified" the vaporic quality in the larger container, and Keely kept the "vivification" up by delivering "a blow now and then."

这把枪有一个球形的旋钮，固定在枪机上，从旋钮上伸出一个直径约等于枪口端部的圆形振动条。枪机直径为4.5英寸，长度为3.5英尺。容纳这种力量或气体的两个容器中较大的一个是由锻铁制成的，但是“无法从中获得任何东西”。这在客人到达之前就已经发生了。基利担心气体已经变得“负抵消”，所以他在大容器和小容器之间“小心地施加打击”。为此，基利使用了一个木槌。一次敲击小容器“增强”了较大容器中的气体性质，基利用“不时的打击”继续保持“活化”。

In loading the gun, the gas check, consisting of three disks having a diameter of almost two inches—two being of hard rubber and the third being of soft rubber—was first placed in position, and then the muzzle was screwed up tight. The bullet was placed in position in the gun and the valve was turned to admit the vapor to the breech. After waiting a few seconds, the end of the vibrator fixed at the breech of the gun would be struck, and the charge exploded. The time between the turning of the valve and the discharge was, on an average, about six seconds. Sometimes, he would need more blows on the vibrator to obtain the discharge. Keely also used his mallet on the gun itself, as it had certain "acoustic properties peculiarly its own," and "blows upon its exterior set a number of vibrators in action distributed through its breech." More  vibrators were part of the interiors of the wrought iron containers.

在加载枪时，由三个直径近两英寸的圆盘组成的气体检查器首先被安装，其中两个是硬橡胶，第三个是软橡胶，然后枪口被紧紧地旋紧。子弹被放置在枪上，然后打开阀门将气体引入枪机。等待几秒钟后，固定在枪机端部的振荡器的末端将被敲击，然后药草就会爆炸。阀门打开到发射的时间平均约为六秒。有时，他需要在振动器上施加更多的打击才能获得发射。基利还在枪上使用他的木槌，因为枪本身具有特殊的“声学特性”，“对其外部的打击会引起许多分布在枪机中的振动器动作。”更多的振动器是锻铁容器内部的一部分。

The operating of the vaporic gun seemed to have been a risky affair at times. Keely would later write that, "It has been impossible for me to write, my right hand and arm were so severely strained, but I have not been idle. I have had time for reflection, and I have been setting up a key to explain vibratory rotation. I have also a plan for a device to be attached to the Liberator as an indicator to show when the neutral center is free  from its intensification while operating. In this way, the dangerous influences will be avoided which present themselves on the extension of the vibratory waves that operate the gun."

使用汽化枪似乎有时是一项冒险的事情。基利后来写道：“我的右手和手臂受伤如此严重，我无法书写，但我并不闲置。我有时间进行反思，我正在建立一个关键来解释振动旋转。我还有一个计划，即在解放者上附加一个装置，用作一个指示器，以显示中性中心在操作时是否从其强化中解放出来。通过这种方式，扩展振动波会带来危险的影响，而这些影响可以避免。”

At the demonstration at Sandy Hook, Keely fired 19 rounds at a target placed 500 yards away. There was no difficulty in sending the bullets that far with a five degree elevation. A conical steel bullet pierced four inches of pine plank placed a few feet from the gun. The noise made by the gun "closely resembled that caused by a common shotgun when loose powder, having no ramming on top of it, is exploded," and "a small cloud of white vapor, which almost instantly disappeared, followed the discharge."

Opinions as to the effectiveness of Keely's gun varied considerably; a witness to its test firing would later say that "I saw the famous gun fired, and it did not amount to much. A good, healthy donkey could kick harder than the projectile struck," but "flattened missiles, spread out by the concussion to about three inches in diameter," convinced another witness of the "marvelous power and instantaneous action of this strange vapor, apparently equal to that of gunpowder itself."

在桑迪胡克的演示中，基利向500码以外放置的目标射出了19发子弹。使用5度仰角将子弹送到那么远并没有什么困难。一个锥形钢弹穿过几英尺远的四吋厚的松木板。这枪发出的噪音“与普通霰弹枪所引起的噪音非常相似，当没有在其顶部压实的散粉被引爆时，”而“一小团白色蒸汽，几乎在瞬间消失了，随着发射出去了。”

The day following the demonstration of the vaporic gun, Keely was visited by a reporter who found him in a lighthearted and talkative mood. Keely "sat in nis dressing gown this evening in the second story of his residence on Oxford Street reading after demonstrating the new motor gun on Saturday in the presence of a party of government officials at Sandy Hook. A satisfied expression was on his face. A reporter... was cautiously examining a vaporic vibrator that lay on the table in the middle of the room. Laying down his paper the inventor wheeled around in his chair, and, after studying for a moment, broke the silence that he has so persistently maintained... 'My experimenting days are over,' he said. "This will develop my active enterprise. Complete success is very near at hand. My experiments at Sandy Hook demonstrated that my vaporic force is a fact and not a mere creation of fancy, as many persons have persisted in declaring. I am now able to produce a power of projection thrice greater than that of gunpowder, and there is no limit to this force. My motor will be completed in less than two months and I will then make a public exhibition of its wonderful powers, which are already in a position to manifest themselves. The adaptation of my force to gunnery is positively assured. I can apply it with more effect than that of nitro-glycerine.'"

蒸汽枪演示后的第二天，一位记者拜访了基利，发现他心情轻松，愿意交谈。基利“这个晚上穿着他的睡袍坐在他位于牛津街二楼的住所里，阅读着资料，周六在桑迪胡克的政府官员面前演示了新型动力枪。他面带满意的表情。一位记者……正在谨慎地检查着放在房间中央桌子上的蒸汽振动器。发明家放下了报纸，转过椅子，经过一会儿的思考，打破了他一直维持的沉默……‘我的实验日子结束了，’他说。“这将促进我的积极创业。全面成功在即。我的桑迪胡克的实验证明，我的蒸汽力量是事实，不是许多人一直坚持认为的想象创造。我现在能够产生一个投射力，是火药的三倍，这个力量没有限制。我的发动机将在不到两个月的时间内完成，然后我将公开展示其惊人的力量，这些力量已经可以表现出来了。我的力量适用于火炮，这是确定无疑的。我可以比硝化甘油使用更有效的方法应用它。”

Being in the best of moods, Keely also explained the principle of his vaporic gun to the reporter. He took what looked like "a policeman's billy" out of a sachel, that, he claimed, was a vibrator. "It is a hollow coil of steel of the finest quality. In one end is an orifice, by which it is attached to the gun. It is the most peculiar piece of steel in the world." Tapping one end of the coil twice on the floor and holding it to the ear of the reporter, the reporter noticed that "the steel cone was humming in a very high key. The noise was like that of a tuning fork." When the reporter took the cone in his hand, he felt that the cone was quivering from one end to the other. "It hums, don't it? No other piece of metal in the world of similar shape will hum at all. ...That steel bar...was the beginning of my motor. By means of it I stumbled on my discoveries. For seven years I have kept flowing through that core a stream of etheric vapor. The action of the vapor has been to affect the relations of the molecules and to alter to a certain extent their conditions. For this reason it has become subject to these vibrations.... There has been no apparent outward change in the steel. Its weight is the same as before, but it is in the process of silent dissolution. Were I to pass through it for 20 years longer this etheric vapor, it would crumble into nothingness. ...The steel cone is necessary for the promulgation of the projecting force of the etheric vapor when applied to gunnery."

处于最佳状态的基利还向记者解释了他的蒸汽枪的原理。他从一个行李袋里拿出了看起来像“警察棍子”的东西，声称这是振动器。“它是最好的钢的空心线圈。一端有孔，可以将其连接到枪上。这是世界上最特殊的钢铁。”他在地板上轻轻敲击钢圈的一端并将其放到记者的耳朵旁边，记者注意到“钢锥在非常高的音调中发出嗡嗡声。噪音像调音叉的声音。”当记者拿起钢锥时，他感觉到锥从一端到另一端都在颤动。“它发出嗡嗡声，不是吗？世界上没有任何形状相似的金属可以发出嗡嗡声。......那根钢棒......就是我的发动机的起点。通过它，我偶然发现了我的发现。七年来，我一直让以太蒸汽流经它的芯子。蒸汽的作用是影响分子之间的关系，并在一定程度上改变它们的状态。因此，它已经变得容易受这些振动的影响......钢的外观没有明显的变化。它的重量与以前一样，但它正在悄然溶解。如果我再让这个以太蒸汽流经20年，它就会化为虚无......钢锥对于推进以太蒸汽在火炮中的投射力是必要的。”

The vaporic gun Keely described as "a breechloading rifle weighing 500 pounds. It was specially constructed for me. On Wednesday last I charged my tube, a five gallon reservoir of wrought iron, one and a half inches thick—with etheric vapor. Then I boxed it up and did not ever test it, so I was certain of its powers. There, hours before the experiments, it remained untouched in my shop. The process of charging it consumed less than four seconds of time. You could not guess how much material was used in making the vapor. ...To project 20 leaden bullets, each weighing nearly five ounces, at a velocity of over 450 feet a second, there was required six drops of water and about a pint of air. From this combination I derived sufficient force to fire 20 bullets of like weight as those used." But during the demonstration of his vaporic gun,  Keely noticed an odd effect: "The most curious thing about all is that I found at the end of my experiments, was that I had increased the power in my tube instead of diminishing it... The initial velocity of the last bullet was more than that of the first one. "

基利所描述的汽化枪是一支重达500磅的后装式步枪。这是专门为我制造的。上周三，我为我的管道充电，这是一个五加仑的熟铁储罐，厚度为1.5英寸，充入以太气体。然后我将它打包，从未测试过，所以我确信它的力量。几个小时前，它还安然无恙地放在我的店里，直到实验开始。充电过程只用了不到四秒钟的时间。你猜不到用了多少材料制造这种汽化气体...为了以超过每秒450英尺的速度发射20个重量近五盎司的铅弹，只需要六滴水和大约一品脱的空气。从这种组合中，我得到了足够的力量来发射和使用这些铅弹。但是在汽化枪的演示过程中，基利注意到了一个奇怪的现象：“所有最奇怪的事情之一是我发现在我的实验结束时，我的管子力量变得更加强大而不是减弱...最后一个子弹的初始速度比第一个子弹还要快。”

The day after his demonstration several daily papers contained favorable articles of what was termed as his "great success." As a consequence, the stock of the Keely Motor Company was sent up from 9 cents on a dollar to 15 cents, "the money of the deluded purchasers was thus successfully netted," as it was wryly commented.

在他的演示后的第二天，几份日报刊登了有利的文章，称他取得了“巨大的成功”。结果，基利发动机公司的股票从每美元九美分上涨到了每美元十五美分，“欺骗性购买者的钱被成功地套现，”这被讽刺地评论道。

Three weeks after the experiment at Sandy Hook, Scientific American, which never saw much in Keely's inventions, published its opinion; to the editors compressed air was the real power behind the vaporic gun, which was referred to as "nothing more than a clumsy air gun."

在桑迪胡克的实验三周后，科学美国人杂志发表了文章，表达了它们的观点；对于编辑来说，压缩空气才是汽化枪背后的真正动力，而这只是一个“笨重的气枪”。这篇文章也表现出该杂志并不看好基利的发明。

Scientific American found a staunch ally in Captain Zalinski of the U.S. Army, who was one of those present at the demonstration at Sandy Hook. He thought along similar lines. He would later declare to the press that he saw Keely "fire his gun by placing some mysterious appliance in the breech, sounding a tuning fork and then opening a brass cock on the reservoir." Zalinski stated that "it was evident to me that Keely had accumulated gas or air under very high pressure. Upon opening the cock spoken of, the air would rush through the copper tube into the air chamber of the gun.  The several seconds that elapsed between the opening of the brass cock on the reservoir and the firing was requisite for the bursting of the diaphragms." Zalinski had his own reasons for denouncing Keely's demonstration, for at around the same time he promoted another invention, the "dynamite gun." This was the joint invention of a number of men and was undergoing tests ordered by the government, under the special direction of Zalinski.91 So naturally Zalinski kept ridiculing Keely's vaporic gun in the press,92 or downplayed the stranger effects that others had noted. He would even visit him in his workshop, but that did not change his opinion of the inventor and his works. He had, he said, taken a pressure gauge with him that would register 10,000 pounds, but Keely refused to use the tool. And although he witnessed him making "a globe revolve by a tuning fork," the demonstration didn't convince him. Returning to the topic of Keely's vaporic gun, Zalinski stated: "I question Mr. Keely's ability...to fire the gun continuously for 100 rounds, maintaining the same high velocity without discarding his flask."

科学美国人杂志和美国陆军的Zalinski上尉是情投意合的盟友之一。Zalinski作为桑迪胡克实验的见证人之一，他认为笨重的气枪只是“一个没有什么用处的气枪”，并且后来向媒体宣布，他看到基利“通过将一些神秘的装置放在膛口，敲响一把音叉，然后打开水箱上的黄铜开关，开枪了。”Zalinski声称，“对我来说，很明显基利积累了高压气体或空气。打开说的水龙头时，空气会穿过铜管进入枪的气室。在水箱上的黄铜开关打开和开枪之间的几秒钟，用于膜的破裂。”Zalinski对于否定基利的实验有他自己的原因，在同一时间，他推广了另一项发明，“炸药枪”。这是几个人的合作发明，并正在进行由政府命令的测试，在Zalinski的特别指导下进行。因此，Zalinski自然而然地在媒体上嘲笑基利的汽化枪，或淡化其他人注意到的更奇怪的效果。他甚至去了基利的工作室，但这并没有改变他对发明家及其作品的看法。他说，他带了一个压力计，会显示10,000磅，但基利拒绝使用这个工具。尽管他亲眼看到他用音叉让“一个球体旋转”，但这次演示并没有使他信服。回到基利的汽化枪话题，Zalinski说：“我质疑基利先生的能力......连续开100轮枪，保持同样的高速度，而不用丢掉他的瓶子。”

But elsewhere it was remarked, just as Keely had noted and told the reporter who had visited him at his home the day after the demonstration, that "Whatever the substance was that Keely carried in a steel tube, it was apparently inexhaustible, the projective force of the nineteenth and last shot being greater than any of the preceding ones, a circumstance that strangely combated the theory of compressed air."

但在别处也有人指出，正如基利所注意到的并告诉参观他家的记者一样，他携带在钢管中的物质显然是不耗尽的，第十九发的推进力比前面任何一发都要大，这种情况奇妙地反驳了压缩空气理论。

Zalinski offered no explanation of this strange detail. Instead he confidently assured that his "rather exceptional experience with air at high pressure enabled me to see possibilities that might not have occurred to others. The air chamber of the gun was so small and the reservoir so large, with a pressure of say, 3,000 Pounds to the square inch, that he could continue firing for a number of shots."

Zalinski没有对这个奇怪的细节做出任何解释。相反，他自信地保证他的“高压空气方面的相当特殊经验使我能够看到别人可能没有想到的可能性。枪的气室很小，储藏室很大，有3000磅每平方英寸的压力，所以他可以继续发射多个炮弹。”

Zalinski also claimed to have offered to produce a similar result "if the company would furnish an outfit which would look like Keely's. This offer was declined. "

Zalinski还声称已经提出了同样的结果，“如果公司提供一套类似于基利的装备，我可以生产出同样的结果。”这个提议被拒绝了。

It would be two years before the statement by Scientific American that Keely had used compressed air in the Sandy Hook experiment was vehemently countered: "That he uses compressed air or any known gas, as charged and insisted upon in the Scientific American, is absurd and totally impossible to conceive of, when we consider the available space for such compressed gas or air in all the cylinders put together which Mr. Keely employs. Besides, the phenomena accompanying the discharges of this gas or vapor after each experiment are entirely different from those of compressed air or ordinary gas. Mr. Keely justly complains that the Scientific American editors keep up the hue and cry of humbug and fraud against him, and at the same time have refused the most urgent invitations extended to them to come to Philadelphia and witness the operations of his discoveries before ridiculing them."

直到两年后，《科学美国人》声称基利在桑迪胡克实验中使用了压缩空气，这一声明才遭到了激烈的反驳：“基利先生使用压缩气体或任何已知气体的指控和坚持在《科学美国人》中是荒谬且完全不可能想象的，因为我们考虑到基利使用的所有缸体中可用的压缩气体或空气的可用空间时，这些空间是有限的。此外，每次实验后伴随着气体或蒸汽的放电现象与压缩空气或普通气体的现象完全不同。基利先生对《科学美国人》编辑们继续对他进行骗局和欺诈的指责感到不满，同时他们拒绝了最紧急的邀请，前来费城观察他的发现操作，然后再对其进行嘲笑。

Keely had always been pestered by persons who claimed that he was a fraud, and although enough was alleged usually nothing was proven beyond any doubt, and nothing substantial had been brought to light. In these uncertain times, another person joined the ranks of those who thought that Keely was a mere swindler, and he, too, claimed that he had a very good reason for stating so: "A story is current here," wrote a newspaper, "that a veteran machinist named Baker, an old resident of Bridgeport, has just returned from Philadelphia with a sensational story to tell. He is represented as having been for the past two years an employee at the workshops of the Keely Motor Company in Philadelphia, and as the representative of a New York capitalist, by whom he was to be paid for the discovery and exposure of Keely's much advertised secret. Now Baker returns to denounce Keely as a fraud, and outlines a book which he promises to write for the education of Wall Street and other parts of this too-confiding world."

基利一直受到声称他是骗子的人的骚扰，尽管通常有足够的指控，但没有什么实质性的事实被揭示。在这不确定的时代，另一个人加入了那些认为基利只是一个骗子的行列，他也声称他有很好的理由这样说：“这里流传着一个故事，”一家报纸写道，“一位名叫贝克的资深机械师，桥港的老居民，刚从费城回来并带了一个轰动性的故事。据说他在过去两年一直是费城基利机车公司的雇员，代表一位纽约资本家，该资本家将向他支付费用，以揭露基利广告宣传的秘密。现在贝克回来指责基利是个骗子，并描述了一本他承诺要为华尔街和这个过于轻信的世界而写的书。”

Baker claims to have been drawing $300 a month from the New Yorker while pursuing his investigations and to have had the full confidence of Keely. Keely, he says, was very careful in engaging him, keeping him at the most unimportant employment until he felt that the man was trustworthy. Baker said it required a year and a half to discover the secret.

Baker声称他在调查时从纽约人手中获得每月300美元的收入，而且基利完全信任他。他说，基利非常小心地雇用他，让他从事最不重要的工作，直到他感到这个人是值得信任的。Baker说，他需要一年半的时间才能发现这个秘密。

Baker also gave an elaborate description of the motor: "The motor proper consisted of a heavy outside covering of metal shaped to deceive the spectator in every way he may look at it. The outside looks as if the machine consisted of a large massive iron cylinder with valves, wheels, and outside pipes. These are supposed to assist in the act of generating the famous new force when in fact the outside shape has little to do with the working parts. Those parts are on the inside. The force is, pure and simple, air, the least bit tainted with a chemical to deceive, as everything else is made to do. The air is pumped from 7 to 21 steel tubes on the inside of the shell. The tubes are of sufficient strength to withstand a pressure of from 10 to 30,000 pounds. There is a mechanism inside the shell that permits the compressed air to pass from one chamber or cylinder at a time into a distinct and separate cylinder which contains the piston that operates the flywheel of the machine. By this method the machine can be kept running five minutes or perhaps longer, and yet show very little change on the pressure gauge. The plan is to allow only one third of the air to escape from one cylinder, and then that one is disconnected, and so on until but one cylinder has been used to that extent, when the machine is stopped and a great show is made, as, of course, the indicated pressure is exactly the same as it was before the wheel went around. Not a drop of water is used at any time. The water story is all bosh."

Baker还对这台发动机进行了详细描述：“发动机的外部是一个重型金属外壳，其形状旨在以各种方式欺骗观众。外部看起来好像是由一个巨大的铁气缸、阀门、轮子和外部管道组成的，这些被认为会在产生这个著名的新型动力时发挥作用，但实际上这些外形几乎没有关系。发动机的运作部件在内部。这个动力源是纯粹的空气，仅稍微掺杂了一些化学物质来欺骗人。空气从外壳内部的7到21个钢管中泵出，这些管道足够坚固，可以承受10到30,000磅的压力。外壳内部有一个机制，可以让压缩空气逐个从一个腔室或气缸进入一个独立的气缸，该气缸内包含操作机器飞轮的活塞。通过这种方法，机器可以持续运行五分钟或更长时间，但在压力表上几乎看不到任何变化。计划是只允许第三个气缸的空气逃逸，然后将其断开连接，以此类推，直到只使用一个气缸，当机器停止时，会表现出很大的戏剧效果，因为指示的压力与轮子旋转之前完全相同。从来没有使用过一滴水。水的故事全是无稽之谈。”

"Such in substance is a long story as it is told by Baker, who alleges that Keely is far from being a practical mechanic and never talks to one, though when a stockholder comes around Keely deluges him with a mixed fantastic jargon, using a hundred terms or more that no mechanic or scientist ever heard before. Baker avers that the idea of a motor was given to him in Newark, N.J., as long ago as 1867, when Dr. George A.  Prindham, then of Newark, now of Philadelphia, constructed a machine in many respects like the Keely motor at the fire engine works of Gould Brothers, on Railroad Avenue in Newark. Keely, he says, captured the idea by haunting the shops. Baker omits to make public the name of the New York capitalist in whose interest he has been playing the detective on Mr. Keely."97 The book that Baker promised to write was never published, and we may only guess at the identity of the New York capitalist.

这是Baker讲述的基利的长篇故事，他声称基利远非实际机械师，也从不与机械师交谈，虽然当股东来访时，基利会用一百多个前所未有的术语向他们喋喋不休，形容各种奇幻的东西。据Baker称，发动机的想法是1867年在新泽西州纽瓦克给他的，当时乔治·A·普林德姆博士（Dr. George A. Prindham）在纽瓦克，现在在费城，构建了一台在许多方面与基利发动机类似的机器，机器是在纽瓦克铁路大道上的Gould Brothers消防机械工厂制造的。他说，基利通过在商店里徘徊来获取这个想法。Baker没有公开这位在他所谓的基利侦探工作中支持他的纽约资本家的名字。”Baker承诺写的书从未出版，我们只能猜测这位纽约资本家的身份。

Was there any truth in Baker's unsettling claims? To find that out, a reporter was sent to follow the trail, and dutifully went to the firm of George & Eberhardt, under which authority the firm of the Gould Brothers now was working. Eberhardt was interviewed, who admitted that "he certainly remembered a machine like the one which Baker claims was made in the shop of the Gould Brothers. We made the machine for Dr. Prindham, and he spent considerable money and time on it. I also recall that one part of the machinery called for a powerful screw of chilled steel and that we found considerable trouble in bringing it to perfection." A brother of Prindham, who was employed in the shop, had more to say: "Yes, I remember it all very well...The Baker you speak of is, I think, very likely A. Beckert, a German we had here. He was employed on work of the kind you mention. It was my brother who tried to get the machine first brought out. A man named Scarttergood one day introduced a tall, lean down Easterner to him and said that the Yankee had a wonderful patent, but he hadn't enough money to bring it out. He wanted to form a stock company, but my brother said he had money enough to bring the thing out, and together they started on it. My brother often went into ecstasies over the invention. ...He often told me that all he need do was to put a quart of cold water and the thing would go and be as powerful as a Cortiss engine, while only occupying one hundredth part of the space and costing only a few hundred dollars."

有没有Baker不安的言论中有任何真相？为了找到答案，一名记者被派遣去追踪线索，并去了George＆Eberhardt公司，该公司现在正在Gould Brothers公司管理下工作。记者采访了Eberhardt，他承认，“他确实记得有一台机器与Baker声称在Gould Brothers工厂制造的那台很像。我们为Prindham博士制造了这台机器，他花费了大量的时间和金钱。我还记得，机器的一个部分需要一颗冷却钢螺丝，我们花了很多时间来完善它。” Prindham的一个兄弟在工厂工作，他有更多的话要说：“是的，我很清楚地记得这一切……你提到的Baker，我认为很可能是一个我们这里的德国人A.Beckert。他被雇用进行与你所提到的这种工作有关的工作。是我兄弟试图首先推出这台机器的。有一天，一个名叫Scarttergood的人向他介绍了一个高个子瘦子的东部人，并说这个美国佬有一个神奇的专利，但他没有足够的钱来推出它。他想组建一家股票公司，但是我兄弟说他有足够的钱将这件事推出去，所以他们开始了。我兄弟经常对这个发明感到欣喜若狂……他经常告诉我，只需加入一夸脱的冷水，发动机就会运行，而且将像Cortiss发动机一样强大，只占用百分之一的空间，成本只有几百美元。”

The device itself was described as "an elaborate affair, with a big cylinder, like the description of Keely's machine. It had a small engine attached to it. He used to put some cyanide of potassium into the pipes and make the thing go, which it would for a short time." The device, however, was not successful; after he paid $300 for the making of the machine lever, and at least $700 or $800 more for the other parts and the patent, Prindham finally gave up in despair and "would have no more to do with it." Unfortunately, Prindham's brother could not recall the name of the patentee, but thought it likely that "the inventor who caused the doctor to invest in it is now with Keely working the same racket in Philadelphia." When the reporter asked if Keely had visited the workshop at one time or another, Prindham's brother ambiguously muttered that yes, "I have seen him around the shop, I think. He was in Newark certainly, but where there are 175 men on one floor of a shop it is almost impossible to remember the names of those who have worked here and left. But I am of the opinion that Keely has been around the shop at one time or another."

该设备被描述为“一个复杂的机器，带有一个大筒，类似于Keely的机器的描述。它上面装有一个小型发动机。他曾经在管道中放了一些氰化钾，让这个东西运行，但只能短暂地持续一段时间。”然而，这个设备并没有成功。 Prindham为制造机器杠杆支付了300美元，至少花费了700-800美元购买其他零件和专利，最终他绝望地放弃了，再也不想管了。不幸的是，普林德姆的兄弟无法记住专利持有人的名字，但认为“导致医生投资该设备的发明家现在可能与Keely在费城从事同样的骗局。”当记者问Keely是否曾经访问过这个车间时，普林德姆的兄弟含糊其辞地说：“是的，我想我在车间周围见过他。他确实在纽瓦克，但在一个工厂的一层楼有175个工人，几乎不可能记住那些曾在这里工作并离开的人的名字。但是我认为Keely可能曾经在这个车间附近。”

As Baker's claims foremost demonstrate, by now everybody was looking into the Keely affair and each uncovered something to their liking. Skeptics and cynics simply saw compressed air as the motive power; but Keely's supporters were sure they beheld the grandiose forces of the cosmos at work in his workshop. There were those who thought of Keely as a mere swindler and as a consequence saw swindlers everywhere connected in a sinister conspiracy of swindlership. There were others who saw a herald of a new and grandiose age for all mankind in the plagued inventor.

正如贝克的声称首先证明的那样，现在每个人都在研究基利的事务，并发现了自己喜欢的东西。怀疑论者和愤世嫉俗者只是将压缩空气视为动力来源; 但基利的支持者确信他们在工作室中看到了宏伟的宇宙力量。有人认为基利只是一个简单的骗子，于是看到到处都是骗局，并认为这是一个邪恶的骗局阴谋。还有其他人在这位备受困扰的发明家身上看到了整个人类新时代的先驱。

An interesting and amusing side-effect of this controversy was that the publicity surrounding Keely dragged many a curious episode of early American history in print that would otherwise have been totally forgotten today. Five years after Baker made his startling claims, but still not had written his promised book, it would be alleged far away in Chicago that, in fact, John Keely at one time had been a person named John Adam Huss. Of this the claimant was absolutely certain: "I knew John W. Keely, the motor man, twenty-two years ago, as John Adam Huss," as a certain Eustace Wyszynski confessed in a letter to a Chicago newspaper.

 这场争议有趣而又好笑的副作用是，围绕基利的宣传掀起了许多早期美国历史中的好奇事件，否则这些事件今天可能已经完全被遗忘了。五年过去了，贝克发布了他惊人的声明，但仍未能如他所承诺的写书。此时，在芝加哥遥远的地方，有人声称，事实上，约翰·基利曾经是一个名叫约翰·亚当·胡斯的人。这名索赔人完全确信：“我22年前认识基利，当时他名叫约翰·亚当·胡斯”，正如某位尤斯塔斯·威申斯基在写给芝加哥一家报纸的信中所坦白的那样。

In 1856, Wyszinski had met a man with that name in Louisville. There, Huss unfolded his plans for what he called a "hydraulic air engine which would relegate steam as a motive power to the past." A number of prominent citizens became interested; a company called The Hydraulic Air Company was formed in three states. Huss was paid "several thousand cash down for the exclusive rights in those states and put on a large salary to superintend the erection of a factory."

在1856年，威申斯基在路易斯维尔遇到了一个叫胡斯的人。在那里，胡斯详细介绍了他所谓的“水力空气发动机”计划，此计划将蒸汽作为动力的时代一去不复返。“水力空气公司”在三个州成立，吸引了一些知名公民的兴趣。为了监督工厂的建设，该公司支付了“数千现金作为在这些州的独家权利，并支付了大量薪水给胡斯”。

After much delay Huss was finally forced to bring out his engine, but "It was a bald failure." A second demonstration was announced, but postponed from time to time. A year later, the date was fixed. The day arrived and the stockholders met. Who then could paint their disappointment when "the ugly rumor reached them that Mr.  Huss had not been seen for a day or so?" Huss fled, and 22 years after the unfortunate incident, Wyszynski showed a reporter stock certificates, cuts of the engine, and records of the money expended.

在经历多次拖延后，胡斯最终被迫推出他的发动机，但是“它彻底失败了”。第二次演示被宣布，但一再推迟。一年后，日期被确定。股东们相聚在一起，期待已久。但当“丑陋的谣言传来，胡斯先生一两天没出现了”时，谁能想象他们的失望。胡斯逃离了现场。在这次不幸事件22年后，威申斯基向一名记者展示了股票证明、发动机的剪影以及支出记录。

"But how does that identify Huss with Keely?" the reporter understandably asked.  Wyszynski explained how the Huss affair "broke up" the business of his son-in-law.  Wyszynski went to work as a map engraver with a lithographic company. "I had been working for them about two years when an incident occurred which subsequent developments have kept as vivid in my memory as if it had occurred yesterday. All efforts to trace Huss had been fruitless, and he had almost passed out of mind. But one day, as I was bending over a lithographic stone, I was aroused by a voice in conversation with Charles W. German, the head of the firm. I looked up. Two men were consulting him as to whether he could make a print of a machine of which they had a small model. One of the men was Huss. As I recognized him he saw me. He and his companion made a bolt for the door and left Mr. German standing dumfounded. 'What in thunder's the matter?' exclaimed Mr. German, when he got his breath. "That's Huss, the air machine man,' I said. 'It's John W. Keely, the machinist,' replied Mr. German, 'and his friend is CM. Babcock, so they introduced themselves.'" That, according to Wyszynski, was the last time that he saw John Adam Huss, "alias John W. Keely, but it isn't the last I've heard of him by a great deal." When Keely began to attract attention in Philadelphia, Wyszynski obtained a description of his device "so far as it had been made public." Wyszynski claimed that he found out that "it was the same thing we had put our money in at Louisville."

记者理所当然地问道：“但这怎么能将胡斯与基利联系起来呢？”威申斯基解释了胡斯的事情是如何“破坏”了他女婿的生意。威申斯基开始在一个石版印刷公司工作，制作地图。他说道：“我在那里工作了大约两年，后来发生了一件事情，随后的发展让我至今记忆犹新，就好像昨天才发生的一样。曾经一直努力寻找胡斯，但是没有任何结果，他几乎被遗忘了。但有一天，我正在制作一个石版，突然听到办公室里有人与公司负责人查尔斯·W·德国人聊天声。我抬起头，看到两个人正在询问他是否能制作一台他们手头有一个小模型的机器的印刷品。其中一个人就是胡斯。当他看到我时，他和他的同伴立刻冲向门口，让德国人目瞪口呆。‘是怎么回事？’德国人喘息道。‘那是胡斯，他的空气机器，’我说。‘那是约翰·W·基利，机械师，’德国人回答道，‘他的朋友是C·M·巴布科克，他们做了自我介绍。’”据威申斯基说，那是他最后一次见到约翰·亚当·胡斯，“也是最后一次听到他的声音。”当基利开始在费城引起注意时，威申斯基获得了关于他的装置“在公开的范围内已被披露”的描述。威申斯基声称他发现这是“我们在路易斯维尔投资的东西”。

But while no comments of Keely or his supporters have survived on Baker's allegations, Keely did have something to say about Wyszynski's strange tale. In a letter to a Philadelphia newspaper, Keely explained that, "The whole of this story, so far as it relates to myself, is an utter fabrication. I do not know one of the parties named...and was never in the city of Louisville in my life. In 1866 I was residing and in business in this city (Philadelphia) at 817 Market Street, and was associated with Bennett C. Wilson. ...I repeat that the whole story, so far as it concerns myself, is a base falsehood."

然而，关于贝克的指控，基利或他的支持者没有留下评论，但是基利对威申斯基的奇怪故事发表了一些言论。在给费城一家报纸的一封信中，基利解释说：“这个故事所涉及到我的一切都是完全捏造的。我不认识任何一个被提到的人……并且在我的一生中从未去过路易斯维尔。在1866年，我住在这个城市（费城），在817 Market Street经商，并与Bennett C. Wilson合作。……我再次重申，这个故事所涉及到我的一切都是彻头彻尾的谎言。”

Considering all the publicity, a great deal would be written, alleged, claimed, speculated and pondered about Keely, both pro and con. Naturally, over the years, various details about him would appear. Several people came forward and told their remembrances of him, and how he appeared to them amidst the furor over his incredible engines.

考虑到所有的宣传，会有大量关于基利的写作、声称、声明、推测和思考，不管是赞成还是反对。自然地，多年来，关于他的各种细节会出现。一些人走出来，讲述他们对他的回忆，以及在他的惊人发动机的狂热中，他是如何出现在他们眼前的。

One of these, when he met Keely, was "impressed by three things: the swarthiness of his complexion, the fact that he wore very large and brilliant diamonds in a very, very dirty shirt front, and the enormous size and malformations of his knuckles. He was playing checkers in his workshop, where his mysterious machine lay silent and grim. The checker-board was grimy, the draughts were grimy and his fingers were grimy."

其中之一，当他遇见基利时，“被三件事打动了：他黝黑的肤色、他在一个非常非常脏的衬衫前佩戴着非常大而明亮的钻石，以及他的指节的巨大尺寸和畸形。他在他的车间里下国际象棋，在那里他神秘的机器默默无声。棋盘脏兮兮的，棋子也脏兮兮的，他的手指也脏兮兮的。”

The person admitted that these were "Trivialities to notice in the presence of a great discovery and a great discoverer," but still, "for some unaccountable reason those were the things which impressed the narrator most, and to this day he never thinks of Keely but what there comes before the mind's vision the spectacle of a man handling dirty checkers with still dirtier fingers. His knuckles as has been said, were enormously large."

那个人承认这些“是在一个伟大的发现和伟大的发现者面前注意到的琐事”，但仍然“出于某种无法解释的原因，这些是给叙述者留下最深印象的事情。直到今天，他只要想起基利，脑海中就会浮现一个用越来越脏的手指拿着肮脏的棋子的人。正如前面所说的，他的指节非常大。”

Another impression of Keely was that he had "a shrewd notion of the value of publicity so far as it whetted the appetite or interest in his mechanical affairs. ...He was affable, good-natured and hearty in his manner. ...When in his shirt sleeves dilating with robust energy of speech on the possibilities of the revolution in science which he would soon create, he seemed to have all the faith and sincerity of the typical inventor struggling with a great thought which those around him had not yet the intellect to grasp. He was...well dressed, well fed in appearance, and sometimes could be seen driving out into the Park with a sealskin cap on his head, and with all the outward indications of comfort. In those days, when out of his shop, he was something of a cross in semblance between a gentleman-like gambler and a sturdy mechanic..  .there were few householders in the Twenty-ninth Ward who seemed to live in more substantial ease. It was this prosperous condition, together with his personal enjoyment, which first caused the cynical to be suspicious of his purpose." Yet it was also written that he was "a rough, rude, crude man, whose personal habits were not expensive."

另一个关于基利的印象是，他“对宣传的价值有着敏锐的认识，因为它煽动人们对他的机械事务的兴趣。...他待人亲切、脾气好、豪爽。...当他穿上衬衫，用精力充沛的语言表达他即将创造的革命性科学可能性时，他似乎具有典型发明家的所有信仰和真诚，他们正在努力理解周围人还没有理解的伟大思想。他穿着得体，外表精神饱满，有时能够看到他戴着海豹皮帽子驾车进入公园，一切都表明他很舒适。那时，当他不在他的店里时，他在外表上类似于绅士般的赌徒和强壮的机械师之间的交叉。...在第29选区几乎没有多少家庭主妇似乎生活更为富裕。正是这种繁荣的状况，以及他个人的享受，首先引起了愤世嫉俗者对他的目的产生了怀疑。”然而，也有人写道，他是一个“粗野、粗鲁、粗糙的人，他的个人习惯不是很昂贵。”

"I can never forget my first sight, and first impression of, and afterwards the introduction given me to this most remarkable man," wrote another. "At the time I speak of, in my daily ride east on a Chestnut Street car, on frequent occasions I was led to observe the entrance of a tall, gaunt, pale-faced man, which striking peculiarity of countenance was in strong contrast with his piercing black eyes and his well-oiled jet black hair. He always was dressed in a rather ill-fitting suit of black cloth, and wearing a very shiny and very conspicuous silk hat, and the bottom of his shirt front was magnificently bedecked with studs of glittering diamonds. I was curiously interested to notice that he invariably left the car at the Continental Hotel. The peculiar fascination of the man's appearance was so impressive upon my guileless heart that I was led to imagine that just such a creature must surely be a black-leg or a gambler, of whom I had been taught to have a holy horror, and who I was led to believe frequently haunted the doorways of that hotel at that time." Since a friend knew Keely, and since Keely was the talk of the town, he obtained an invitation to visit him in his workshop, so off they went: "...we made our way to the back door of an old shanty in the upper portion of the city, which, as I did not keep up an acquaintance with the locality, I am not sure of its being the same veritable workshop which is still, or was until recently, the scene of so much mystifying and wondering comment. Upon a gentle rap the door was opened, and to my surprise upon beholding was the working man of mystery, the diamond-bedecked creature whom I had so ingloriously connected with the Continental Hotel."

另一个人写道：“我永远不会忘记我第一次看到和第一次印象深刻的，以及之后给我介绍这位最卓越的人。”在我所说的那个时候，我每天坐栗色街车向东行驶，经常会注意到一个高大、瘦削、面色苍白的人进入，他那引人注目的面容特征与他锐利的黑眼睛和涂油得很好的乌黑发色形成了强烈的对比。他总是穿着一套相当不合身的黑布衣服，戴着非常光滑和非常显眼的丝质帽子，他衬衫前面的下摆镶嵌着闪闪发光的钻石饰品。我非常有兴趣地注意到，他总是在大陆酒店下车。这个人的奇特魅力对我的单纯心灵印象深刻，我被引导去想象，这样的人一定是黑客或赌徒，我曾被教导要对此敬而远之，而且我被引导相信，他们经常在那个时候出现在酒店的门口。”由于一位朋友认识基利，而且基利成为城里的谈资，他们被邀请参观他的工作室，于是他们出发了：“...我们来到了城市上部一个旧小屋的后门，由于我没有和当地人保持联系，我不确定它是否是同样真实的工作室，直到最近，还是那么神秘和好奇。轻轻敲门，门开了，让我惊讶的是，站在门口的是这位神秘的工人，那个身着钻石的人，我曾经如此不光彩地将他与大陆酒店联系在一起。”

Another attempt to put a frame around the personality of the man was made by a Dr. George Mays, who was one of Keely's neighbors in the northwestern part of Philadelphia. He too was impressed by the large diamonds upon a very seedy shirt front. "I met him often during the past twenty years and must say that he always seemed to me to be under the influence of some haunting Nemesis. Outside of his workshop he was always in a hurry, whether he had anything to do or not, and it was almost impossible to engage him in a social conversation for any length of time, so important did he try to make his work appear, at least such of his neighbors as he knew were skeptical concerning his motor." His neighbors though, appeared to "have been fascinated by the man as he posed amid the mysteries of his workshop."

还有一个试图给这个人格框架的尝试是由一位名叫乔治·梅斯的医生进行的，他是基利在费城西北部的邻居之一。他也被那些布满钻石的破烂衬衫前襟所打动。“在过去的二十年里，我经常见到他，必须说他总是让我觉得他受到了某种令人困扰的命运的影响。在他的工作室外，无论他是否有事情要做，他总是匆忙忙的，几乎不可能和他进行长时间的社交对话，因为他试图让他的工作看起来很重要，至少他认为他的邻居们对他的发动机持怀疑态度。”不过，他的邻居们似乎“被这个人在他的工作室秘密中的姿态所吸引。”

Keely's diamonds led to another minor controversy, but he told a friend that he merely purchased some diamonds "as an investment."

基利的钻石引起了另一次小小的争议，但他告诉他的朋友说，他只是购买了一些钻石“作为投资”。

Another sketch, although made 10 years after the time-period in this chapter, described him as "a large, powerfully built man, with a large head, square shaven jaw, with heavy, dark-side whiskers, tinged with gray, and dark eyes which move rapidly.  His movements are nervously quick and his speech is extremely rapid, as though it could not catch up with his thought. He impresses one with the belief that he is absorbed in what he calls his life study, that time is short and that every nerve must be strained to accomplish practical results while life remains."

另一份素描，虽然是在本章时间段之后的10年制作的，但是将他描述为“一个身材高大，身体强壮的人，头部较大，下巴方正而剃过，厚重的、带有灰色的暗色胡须和快速移动的黑眼睛。他的动作非常迅捷，言语也非常迅速，好像无法赶上他的思想。他让人相信他专注于他所谓的人生研究，时间很短，必须竭尽全力在有生之年取得实际成果。”

Keely also possessed great physical strength when he was in the prime of his life, and "used to take pride" in exhibiting this: "One of his feats was to put two planks side by side, set on the top of them a barrel of plaster weighing 225 pounds, place a second and even a third barrel of plaster on top of the first, and then lift the whole from the ground."

基利在自己的巅峰时期也拥有极大的体力，并“以献技为荣”：“他的一个技艺是将两个木板并排放置，放上一个称重225磅的石膏桶，然后在第一个石膏桶的顶部甚至第二个和第三个石膏桶，然后将整个物体从地面上抬起。”

These were glimpses of the man who by now was about to enter the second, most dramatic decade of his life, and the final years of a most unusual and astonishing career.

这些是这位人已进入他的生命的第二个、最激动人心的十年，也是他那个非常不寻常、惊人的职业生涯的最后几年的一瞥。
