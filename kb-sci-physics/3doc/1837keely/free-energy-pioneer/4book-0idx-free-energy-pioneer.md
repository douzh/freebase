Over a century ago, a man in Philadelphia made the most important discovery of all time: a mysterious source of free, unlimited energy. He experimented with the substance for years, building a staggering 2,000 machines and devices that ran on his esoteric force.

一个世纪以前，费城的一个人发现了有史以来最重要的发现：一种神秘的自由、无限能源。他对这种物质进行了多年的实验，建造了2,000台机器和装置，运行在他的神秘力上。 

His eccentric vision led him to experiment with anti-gravity and the disintegration of solid matter. Numerous people witnessed his demonstrations, and his work was well known to Nikola Tesla, Jules Verne and Thomas Edison. The occult underground was inescapably drawn to him, and early science fiction still owes him a debt of gratitude. The name of the enigmatic inventor: John Worrell Keely. He was one of the world's first and foremost free-energy pioneers.

他的古怪想法让他尝试抗重力和固体物质的瓦解。许多人见证了他的演示，他的工作被尼古拉·特斯拉、儒勒·凡尔纳和托马斯·爱迪生广泛知晓。神秘的地下组织不可避免地被吸引到他身上，早期的科幻小说仍然欠他一个恩情。这位神秘的发明家的名字叫约翰·沃雷尔·基利。他是世界上最早和最杰出的自由能源先驱之一。 
 

In a dazzling and extremely detailed tour de force, European author and researcher Theo Paijmans takes us on a unique journey through the very underground of freeenergy research, exploring the depths of numerous secret societies and occult orders, and examining the influence of these mysterious techno-occultists and their incredible ideas - including the ultimate evolution of humans through free-energy. Paijmans clearly demonstrates that Keely and these inventors did not work in isolation, but in the confines of a very secret and silent tradition - the tradition of occult technology.

欧洲作家和研究员西奥·佩曼斯通过一次令人眼花缭乱的非常详细的壮举带领我们穿越自由能源研究的地下世界，探索了众多秘密社团和神秘组织的深处，探讨了这些神秘的技术-神秘主义者及其令人难以置信的想法的影响，包括通过自由能源的最终人类进化。佩曼斯清楚地证明，基利和这些发明家并不是孤立工作的，而是在一种非常秘密和沉默的传统中工作——神秘主义技术传统。

# 简介

Introduction

How would you like to be able to install a spherical tank in your back room and make five million dollars?

That's the legend that has long surrounded a gentleman in Philadelphia named John Keely. Many learned scholars (and a number of total crackpots) have claimed for a century that Mr. Keely really used a hidden spherical tank of compressed air to run the phenomenal machine he invented and spent a large part of his life building and rebuilding.

Actually, the famous Keely machine was a very complicated device...so complicated, in fact, that maybe he did not understand it himself. Leading scientists, engineers and journalists visited his workshop to see   demonstrations, eagerly expecting to expose him. But after most demonstrations they enthusiastically whipped
out their checkbooks, all wanting a piece of the machine Keely had convinced them would revolutionize the world.

This book, the result of years of research by European author Theo Paijmans, tells the whole story for the first time. It is an amazing, heavily documented contribution to the mysterious land of basement inventors, and others who have spent their lives trying to develop free energy.

Keely found the secret, and it lies somewhere in this book. Mr. Paijmans has sifted through everything ever published about John Keely, and assembled a collage of stunning detail. He proves once and for all that the tales of compressed air are nothing but hot air. But the carefully drawn descriptions of the actual machines also seem to eliminate the recurrent theories about atomic energy. Water appears to have played a key part, as did sound waves and harmonics. Keely could produce thousands of pounds to a square inch and produce a power that could bend bars of steel.

As time passed, Keely's machines grew smaller. At first they weighed tons, later they were the size of dinner plates. Unfortunately, whenever the inventor was asked to describe the principles behind it all, he resorted to his own non-technical neologisms, only adding to the confusion. Mr. Paijmans has laboriously turned such passages into basic English, and perhaps some astute reader can even build one of these machines.

Another part of the Keely legend is exploded in this monumental work. He was not a charlatan and swindler. John Keely lived modestly, giving large sums of money to metal-workers, foundries and manufacturers who constructed parts of his machines (eventually he built over 120 of them). If anything, he was frequently conned out of
money by numerous companies and individuals, according to Paijmans' research.

The author leaves no cult unturned. John Keely was a contemporary of manyof the great occultists, like Rudolph Steiner, Madam Blavatsky, even Jules Verne. Some were ardent supporters of Keely's work, and their ghostly presence's are woven throughout this book.

Mr. Paijmans has carved his own permanent niche among them by producing an epic book that will be studied for generations to come.

这是有关费城先生约翰·基利的传奇故事。许多有学问的学者（以及一些完全的疯子）声称一个世纪以来基利先生使用了隐藏的压缩气体球体罐来驱动他发明并花费了大部分时间建造和重建的惊人机器。 
 
实际上，著名的基利机器是一个非常复杂的装置……事实上，可能连他自己都不理解。领先的科学家、工程师和记者参观了他的工作室，希望揭露他，但在大多数演示后，他们热情地拿出支票簿，都想要一部基利所说的将会改变世界的机器的一部分。 
 
这本书是欧洲作家Theo Paijmans多年研究成果，首次讲述整个故事。这是对地下发明者和其他一些一生致力于开发自由能源的人神秘世界的惊人、大量文献资料支持的贡献。 
 
基利发现了秘密，这本书里也许有答案。Paijmans先生筛选了有关约翰·基利的一切出版物，并组织了一个令人惊叹的细节拼贴图。他一劳永逸地证明了压缩空气的故事都是说风凉话。但实际机器的精心描述也似乎排除了关于原子能的重复理论。水似乎发挥了关键作用，声波和谐波也是如此。基利能够产生每平方英寸数千磅的压力，并产生能够弯曲钢筋的力量。 
 
随着时间的推移，基利的机器变得越来越小。起初它们重量达到吨级，后来只有餐盘大小。不幸的是，每当发明者被要求描述其中的原则时，他会采用自己的非技术新词，只会让人更加困惑。Paijmans先生费尽心思地将这些段落转化为基础英语，也许一些敏锐的读者甚至可以构建出这些机器中的一部分。 
 
这部巨著揭示了基利传奇的另一部分。他不是一个骗子和骗子。约翰·基利过着朴素的生活，向制造他的机器部件的金属工人、铸造车间和制造商捐赠了大笔资金（最终他建造了超过120台机器）。根据Paijmans的研究，他常常被许多公司和个人骗走钱财。 
 
作者不吝言辞地探讨了所有与基利相关的信仰团体。约翰·基利是许多大古奇学家的同代人，例如鲁道夫·斯坦纳、布拉瓦茨基夫人，甚至是儒勒·凡尔纳。他们中的一些人是基利工作的狂热支持者，他们的幽灵存在贯穿了整本书。 
 
通过创作这本史诗般的书，Paijmans 先生为自己在其中矗立起了一个永久的地位，这本书将被研究和传承几代人。

# 前言

Foreword

Almost a decade before Charles Jeantaud invented the electric automobile, an inventor in America named John Worrell Keely claimed to have made an even more important discovery. Not a combination of two known devices, the carriage and the electromotor, nor the development of a crude fossil fuel burner, but the discovery of
an entirely new form of energy.

在查尔斯·让托发明电动汽车近十年前，一位名为约翰·沃雷尔·基利的美国发明家声称他发现了比电动汽车更加重大的一项发现。不是两种已知设备的组合，马车和电动机，也不是对原始化石燃料燃烧器的改进，而是发现了一种全新的能源形式。

When the first electric taxi appeared on the streets of London, Keely was still experimenting and working to construct the ideal machine that would operate on his force, and he was still fathoming the incredible secrets of the energy he discovered. In the process, many machines and wonderful devices were built. Many people attended his demonstrations. Keely had visions and he had dreams. Cars, ships, aeroplanes, even spaceships would someday be propelled with his force. Man could travel to the stars and would have an unlimited, everlasting and clean source of energy at his disposal. A golden age dawned for all!

当第一辆电动出租车在伦敦街头亮相时，基利仍在尝试实验和构建能够运行在自己发现的能源上的完美机器，同时仍在探索这种令人难以置信的能量的秘密。在此过程中，他制造了许多机器和神奇的装置，许多人参加了他的演示。基利有着宏伟的愿景和梦想，他相信汽车、船只、飞机甚至太空船都将有一天由他的能源推动前进。人类可以前往星际旅行，并拥有一种无限、永恒、清洁的能源，为所有人带来黄金时代的到来！

However, in 1901 when Edison stated that he would build a super battery, Keely, who at one time invited him to inspect his inventions, had already been dead for three years. Today, Edison is well remembered, as are his inventions. Keely fared less well, as did his discovery. What was the fate of Keely's inventions and his many devices? 

然而，1901年当爱迪生宣称他将会建造一种超级电池时，基利已经去世三年了。尽管基利曾经邀请爱迪生来检查他的发明，但如今爱迪生及其发明家族已经被广泛铭记。然而，基利及其发现的命运则不那么如意。基利的发明和他的许多装置最终怎样了呢？

What was the essence of that mysterious energy that he claimed to have discovered that could have changed the course of history? Why was the technology of the enigmatic inventor so quickly forgotten?

基利声称发现了可以改变历史进程的神秘能量的本质是什么？为什么这位神秘发明家的技术被如此迅速地遗忘了呢？

With these questions and many others in mind, I embarked on my search. I began my attempt to reconstruct the life of John Worrell Keely, one of the most puzzling and mysterious inventors of the 19th century.

怀着这些问题和其他许多问题，我开始了我的搜索。我试图重建19世纪最令人费解和神秘的发明家之一约翰·沃雷尔·基利的生平。

While studying Keely's life and inventions it was necessary to research other littleknown areas, sifting through archives, collections and specialized libraries on two continents and in five countries. During my research I encountered strange tales and histories, and the obstacles I encountered were many.

在研究基利的生平和发明时，有必要研究其他鲜为人知的领域，筛选两个大陆和五个国家的档案、收藏品和专业图书馆。在我的研究中，我遇到了奇怪的故事和历史，也遇到了许多障碍。

All of Keely's writings, except for a few fragments here and there, have disappeared. What remains is contemporary newspaper articles, testimonies and memoirs of people who knew him personally, or who were lucky enough to meet him at one time or another. And as in any collection of sources, there is a certain percentage of
impurity, contradiction, misunderstanding, and embellishments on tall tales or outright yarns.

除了零星几篇没有消失外，基利的所有著作都已经消失。现在我们只能从当时的报纸文章、认识他的人的证言和回忆录，或者是在某个时候有幸与他见面的人的回忆中了解他。而在任何来源的收集中，不可避免地存在着一定的杂质、矛盾、误解和夸张的故事或编造的故事。

It appeared that people did not always grasp what Keely was exploring, what his aim was, or what the nature of his enigmatic source of energy was. Although the accounts do paint something of his life, his explorations and the controversy he unwillingly evoked, these form only the visible part - his public life, the surface.

似乎人们并不总是能够理解基利正在探索什么，他的目标是什么，以及他神秘能量的本质是什么。尽管这些记述描述了他的生活，他的探索和他无意中引起的争议，但这些只构成了可见的部分——他的公众生活，表面上的一面。

But the Keely history has a much deeper layer. To my surprise I uncovered the outlines of a strange tradition where the early free-energy inventors and the esoteric underground meet, a tradition involved in the creation and construction of what I have termed 'occult technology.' Lured into the center of Keely's labyrinthine history, I found myself delving into the heart of the 19th and 20th century occult undercurrents, and was amazed to find Keely's heritage there, and in some quarters still very much alive.

但是，基利的历史有更深层次。令我惊讶的是，我揭示了早期自由能发明家和神秘地下组织相遇的奇怪传统的轮廓，这是一种涉及创造和构建我所称的“神秘技术”的传统。被吸引进基利的迷宫般的历史中心，我发现自己深入了19世纪和20世纪神秘主义的潜流之中，并惊讶地发现基利的遗产在那里，并且在某些圈子里仍然非常活跃。

There was an obscure current that I have termed 'the early 19th century antigravity underground.' There were ambiguous hints in certain 19th century futuristic novels. There were other free-energy inventors. There were connections and influences crossing lands, continents, philosophies and times...all of which will be offered to the reader in this book.

有一个我所称的模糊的潮流——“19世纪早期反重力地下组织”，在某些19世纪的未来主义小说中有模糊的暗示，还有其他的自由能发明家，这些人之间存在跨越地域、大陆、哲学和时间的联系和影响……所有这些都将在这本书中向读者呈现。

The information that 1 was able to find that has survived into this century, is in this book. The Keely history is also a Keely mystery; his personal papers do not seem to have survived. What happened to these is a  tantalizing question that haunts us even today.

我能找到并留存到本世纪的信息都在这本书中了。基利的历史也是一个谜团，他的个人文件似乎没有存活下来。这些文件到底发生了什么，这是一个令人着迷的问题，甚至今天我们仍在被困扰。

Much of the information in these pages is published here for the first time in more than a century, or for the first time in connection to each other. In many of the notes you may find the source for these materials and you may see how a particular line of thought in the Keely history, erroneous or not, developed from a specific source. 

这些页面中的许多信息在一个多世纪以来首次以这种形式发表，或者首次与彼此有关。在许多笔记中，您可以找到这些材料的来源，并了解基利历史中某种思路（无论正确与否）是如何从特定来源发展出来的。

At each turn of my research, care was taken to use the most thorough studies in the fields, and as many primary sources as possible. When I found an anecdote in several clippings, I preferred the articles published in the Philadelphia newspapers, and not in a newspaper miles away from the event or incident, although I compared them for discrepancies. When I found similarities or dissimilarities in content, I described so in the notes.

在我的研究中，每一次转折都非常注意使用在领域内最彻底的研究和尽可能多的一手资料。当我在几篇剪报中发现一个轶事时，我更喜欢发表在费城报纸上的文章，而不是发生事件或事件的报纸，尽管我会比较它们是否存在差异。当我发现内容相似或不相似时，我会在注释中进行描述。

Those who wish to follow the strange trail where dreams and reality meet, may be especially interested in the last chapter which —I must warn beforehand —is quite speculative in nature.

那些希望追随梦想和现实相遇的奇怪之路的人，可能对最后一章特别感兴趣，我必须事先警告——它的性质是相当推测性的。

One of the pleasures of writing this book was in the people that I came to know. They are mentioned in my acknowledgments. These times witness an upsurge of interest in Keely's life and inventions. I hope that this book will offer enough materials to all those persons to satisfy their interest. Please feel free to contact me for the useful exchange of materials, if you have additional information that may shed light on the subject, or to discuss the materials in this book.

写这本书的乐趣之一是认识了一些人，他们在我的致谢中有提到。现在有越来越多的人对基利的生活和发明感兴趣。我希望这本书能够为所有这些人提供足够的材料，满足他们的兴趣。如果您有更多可以阐明这个主题的信息，或者想讨论本书中的材料，请随时联系我进行有益的交流。
