# 中立中心

The Neutral Center (by John Ernst Worrell Keely)

"A center of introductory action is necessary in all operations of Nature."

“在⾃然的所有运作中，⼀个引导⾏动的中⼼是必要的。”

All structures require a foundation. This neutral center is the foundation.

所有结构都需要基础。这个中⽴中⼼是基础。

"Every molecule, every mass, every moving body in space, every solar system, every stellar system, EVERY ROTATORY SYSTEM, is built about a NEUTRAL CENTER. It is the indestructible unit around which all that we recognize as matter is built. Immovable itself, it moves all things. Indestructible itself throughout infinity of time, it creates all things. It produced and preserves the incalculable energy of motion of the entire Universe. It bears the unthinkable burden of the mass of the Universe. It is the most wonderful thing Man has discovered in the Universe since he discovered fire.

“每一个分子、每一个质量、太空中的每一个运动体、每一太阳系、每一恒星系统、每一旋转系统，都是围绕着一个中性中心构建的。它是一个不可摧毁的单元，我们所认识的物质都围绕着它构建。它本身是不可移动的，它移动着所有的东西。它在无限的时间内是不可破坏的，它创造了所有的事物。它产生并保存了整个宇宙不可估量的运动能量。它承受着宇宙质量的难以想象的负重。这是人类发现火以来在宇宙中发现的最美妙的东西。”。

"If we should take a planet of say 20,000 miles diameter and should displace a portion of the interior so as to have a crust of say 5,000 miles thickness, and at the center of the planet, place a billiard ball, that small mass, immeasurably smaller than the bulk of the earth, would bear the entire burden of the mass of the crust 5,000 miles thick and would keep it equidistant from itself. No power, however great, could possibly displace this central mass so as to bring it into contact with the crust. Furthermore, to move this central mass in any direction, would require a force sufficient to move the entire mass of the planet, and in propagating or continuing any such motion the neutral center, this billiard ball, will at all time periods remain still in the exact center, bearing the same equidistant relation to its hollow shell. The mind staggers in contemplating the burden borne by this neutral center, where weight ceases." No less wonderful are other properties of the neutral center.

“如果我们取一颗直径约20000英里的行星，将其内部的一部分移动，使其地壳厚度约为5000英里，并在行星中心放置一个台球，那么这个比地球体积小得多的小质量将承担5000英里厚的地壳质量的全部负重，并使其与自身保持等距。任何力量，无论多么强大，都不可能移动这个中心质量，使其与地壳接触。此外，要使这个中心质量向任何方向移动，都需要足够的力来移动行星的整个质量，而在传播或继续任何这种运动时，中性中心，这个台球，将在任何时候，时间段都保持在精确的中心，与它的空心外壳具有相同的等距关系。当思考这个中性中心所承受的负担时，大脑会颤抖，因为重量在那里停止了。“中性中心的其他特性也同样美妙

"It is the cause of the physical Universe. Its attraction condensed that which we recognize as substance. Matter was evolved from the affinity of this neutral center for sympathetic streams and since it is immovable, it caused, through negative attraction the formation of nodes in these streams, where the vibrations thereafter continued to meet in a center of sympathetic coincidence causing the permanence of form and matter. Every nebula, an embryonic world, is acted upon, created and preserved by this neutral center, and at the termination of its cycle, it is ultimately also destroyed by it, causing its absorption into the Unknown from whence it came.

“它是物理宇宙的起因。它的吸引⼒浓缩成了我们所认识的物质。物质是从这个中性中⼼对交感流的亲和⼒演变⽽来的，因为它是不可移动的，所以它通过负吸引⼒导致节点的形成这些流，此后振动继续在⼀个交感重合的中⼼相遇，导致形式和物质的永久性。每个星云，⼀个胚胎世界，都受到这个中性中⼼的作⽤、创造和维持，并在其周期结束时，它最终也被它摧毁，导致它被吸收到它来⾃的未知世界中。

"The actual neutral center of the earth is, in fact, even infinitely smaller than the billiard ball referred to above. It consists of a compound interetheric point in space, so small that were we to magnify a pin head to the size of the sun, and from that substance take a particle of matter the same size, again magnifying it to the size of the sun, the neutral center would still be invisible, even though the structure of this last substance was examined through the highest powered microscope ever created, or to be created. For the neutral center is INDIVISIBLE. Its attributes do not belong to matter, and pertain in no way to matter, which is but its exterior manifestation.

“事实上，地球的实际中性中⼼甚⾄⽐上⾯提到的台球⼩得多。它由空间中的复合以太点组成，⼩到我们可以将针头放⼤到太阳的⼤⼩，并从该物质中取出⼀个相同⼤⼩的物质粒⼦，再次将其放⼤到太阳的⼤⼩，中性中⼼仍然是不可⻅的，即使最后⼀种物质的结构是通过有史以来最⾼功率的显微镜检查的，因为中性中⼼是不可分割的。它的属性不属于物质，也绝不属于物质，物质只是它的外在表现。

"Every aggregate mass consists of molecules, each of which has its neutral center where the three modes of vibration, dominant, harmonic, and enharmonic, meet in a center of sympathetic coincidence and are equated without cancellation of their energy."

“每个聚集体都由分⼦组成，每个分⼦都有其中性中⼼，其中三种振动模式（主振动模式、谐波振动模式和等和谐振动模式）在交感重合的中⼼相遇，并且在不抵消其能量的情况下相等。”

"The fixed neutral center of the earth is the concentration or totalized power of all the several molecular neutral centers in the earth's mass. This neutral center, which is absolutely WITHOUT WEIGHT, an interetheric point in space, communicates direct by means of its outflow of sympathy, with every planetary mass in the Universe. Through its inflow of sympathy, through the solar intermediate, the sun, it receives the life flow from the SUPREME NEUTRAL CENTER that enables it to perpetuate its existence. Thus through the outflow from this Supreme Neutral Center that pivoting point of the Universe controls the existence and motion of not only every stellar, solar and planetary mass in space, but also the rotatory vibration, in every individual molecule, intermolecule, etc. through all the subdivisions of matter, thereby sustaining their existence and motion with the life flow.

“地球的固定中性中心是地球物质中所有分子中性中心的浓度或总功率。这个绝对没有重量的中性中心是太空中的以太点，它通过交感的流出与宇宙中的每一个行星物质直接通信。通过交感的流入，通过太阳中间体，它接收来自最高中性中心的生命流，使其能够持续存在。因此，通过从这个最高中性中心流出，宇宙的枢转点不仅控制着太空中每一颗恒星、太阳和行星物质的存在和运动，还控制着每一个分子、分子间等的旋转振动。”通过物质的所有细分，从而维持它们的存在和随着生命流的运动。

"All foundations must be sufficient to bear their burden. Conceive then the Universe centered upon and resting the burden of is incalculable mass and kinetic energy on a vacuous interetheric point in space, so minute that it is actually INDIVISIBLE. This conception can only be fully comprehended by an infinite mind. Independent of time, because indestructible in its unity, independent in space, because through its properties space itself exists and without it would not exist, independent of matter because its properties in an external direction created all that we know as matter and gave it seeming permanence, the neutral center is that protean, uncreated, indestructible, forever-existing FIRST CAUSE. Without hands, without tools, without thought, without emotion, without love, without form, without substance, it, of itself, created all these. All that we see or can see in the objective Universe exists because of and by means of the properties and powers of the NEUTRAL CENTER.

“所有的基础都必须⾜以承受它们的负担。那么想象⼀下，宇宙以空间中的⼀个空虚的以太点为中⼼，并将其承载着不可估量的质量和动能，如此之⼩，以⾄于它实际上是不可分割的。这个概念只能是充分的独⽴于时间，因为它的统⼀性是坚不可摧的；独⽴于空间，因为通过它的属性，空间本身存在，没有它就不会存在；独⽴于物质，因为它在外部⽅向上的属性创造了我们所知道的⼀切物质并赋予它看似永恒的东⻄，中性中⼼是千变万化的，⾮创造的，坚不可摧的，永远存在的第⼀因。没有双⼿，没有⼯具，没有思想，没有情感，没有爱，没有形式，没有实质，它本身，创造了所有这些。我们在客观宇宙中看到或能看到的所有东⻄都是由于中⽴中⼼的属性和⼒量⽽存在的。

"No machine heretofore constructed has been made with a neutral center. This conception of mechanics has never before dawned on man's thought field. Had this been done, perpetual motion would have become a demonstrated fact. Were a machine so constructed as to use its properties, an introductory impulse would suffice to run it for centuries. However, this would not be a useful mechanical contrivance for no more energy could be obtained from it than was originally given, and its only value would be as a timekeeper." Keely did not seek to invent, nor did he claim to have invented, perpetual motion.

"The neutral center is only established when rotation exceeds 100 revolutions per minute, which is sufficient, with the vibratory circuit running at 100,000 per second, to neutralize the influence of gravity on the volume of the neutral third of the sphere." The neutral center controls its sphere of operation, whether that mass controlled by it be homogeneous or complex. All differential mass antagonism is equated on the induction of certain orders of vibration. The structural conditions can be entirely adverse, even of unlike states -- gases with liquids, liquidswith solids, solids with gases, its controlwill be as complete in one case as in the other.

"The condition of unstable equilibrium was born in each neutral center, that by means of this arrangement, the neutral center might become the connective link or controlling tendency, holding these two properties in balance and assuming either phase at will. Between the dispersing positive and the attractive negative it stands, the deciding factor, the Universal Will. "The action that induces this property I call the connective link is sympathetic planetary oscillation."
