Theory and Formula of Aqueous Disintegration (by John Keely)

The peculiar conditions as associated with the gaseous elements of which water is composed, as regards the differential volume and gravity of its gases, make it a ready and fit subject of vibratory research. In submitting water to the influence of vibratory transmission, even on simple thirds, the high action induced on the hydrogen as contrasted with the one on the oxygen (under the same vibratory stream) causes the antagonism between these elements that induces dissociation. The differential antagonistic range of motion, so favoring the antagonistic thirds as to become thoroughly repellant. The gaseous element thus induced and registered, shows thousands of times much greater force as regards tenuity and volume than that induced by the chemical disintegration of heat, on the same medium. In all molecular disso- ciation or disintegration of both simple and compound elements, whether gaseous or solid, a stream of vibratory antagonistic thirds, sixths, or ninths, on their chord mass will compel progressive subdivisions. In the disintegration of water the instrument is set on thirds, sixths, and ninths, to get the best effects. These triple conditions are focalized on the neutral center of said instrument so as to induce perfect harmony or concordance to the chord note of the mass chord of the instruments full combination, after which the diatonic and the enharmonic scale located at the top of the instrument, or ring, is thoroughly harmonized with the scale of ninths which is placed at the base of the vibratory transmitter with the telephone head. The next step is to disturb the harmony on the concentrative thirds, between the transmitter and the disintegrator. This is done by rotating the siren so as to induce a sympathetic communication along the nodal transmitter, or wire, that associates the two instruments. When the note of the siren becomes concordant to the neutral center of the disintegrator, the highest order of sympathetic communication is established. It is now necessary to operate the transferable vibratory negatizer or negative accelerator, which is seated in the center of the diatonic and enharmonic ring, at the top of the disintegrator, and complete disintegration will follow (from the antagonisms induced on the concordants by said adjunct)in triple progression, thus: First thirds: Molecular dissociation resolving the water into a gaseous compound of hydrogen and oxygen. Second: sixths, resolving the hydrogen and oxygen into a new element by second order of dissociation, producing what I call low atomic ether. Third: ninths, the low atomic ether resolved into a new element, which I denominate high or second atomic harmonic. All these transmissions being simultaneous on the disturbance of sympathetic equilibrium by said negative accelerator.

EXAMPLE:

Taking the chord mass of the disintegrator B flat, or any chord mass that may be represented by the combined association of all the mechanical parts of its structure (no two structures being alike in their chord masses) taking B flat, the resonators of said structure are set at B flat first octave, B flat third octave and B flat ninth octave by drawing out the caps of resonators until the harmony of thirds, sixths, and ninths are reached; which is simple movement of the fingers on the diatonic scale, at the head, will determine by the tremulous action which is highly sensible to the touch, on said caps. The caps are then rigidly fixed in their different positions by set screws. The focalization to the neutral center is then established by dampening the steel rods, on the back of the scale, representing the thirds, sixths and ninths, drawing a piece of small gum tube over them, which establishes harmony to the chord mass of the instrument. Concordance is thus effected betweenthe disintegrator and the ninths of the scale at base of transmitters with telephonic head.

中文: 取分解器B的弦质量为平，或可由其结构的所有机械部件的组合组合表示的任何弦质量为B（没有两个结构的弦质量相同），通过拔出谐振器的帽，将所述结构的谐振器设置在B平的第一八度、B平的第三八度和B平的九度，直到达到三分之一、六分之一和九分之一的和声；这是手指在全音阶上在头部的简单运动，将由对所述帽子的触摸高度敏感的颤抖动作决定。然后通过固定螺钉将盖子刚性地固定在它们的不同位置。然后，通过阻尼标尺背面代表三分之一、六分之一和九分之一的钢条，在钢条上画一根小胶管，来建立对中性中心的聚焦，从而与乐器的和弦质量建立和谐。

This scale has a permanent sympathetic one, set on the ninth of any mass chord that may be represented, on any and all the multiple variations of mechanical combinations. In fact, permanently set for universal accommodations.

中文: 他的音阶有一个永久的共鸣音阶，设置在任何可能代表的质量和弦的第九个，任何和所有机械组合的多重变化上。事实上，永久设置为通用位置。

The next step is to establish pure harmony between the transmitter and the disintegrator, which is done by spinning the siren disk, then waiting until the sympathetic note is reached, as the siren chord, decreasing in velocity, descends the scale. At this juncture, the negative accelerator must be immediately and rapidly rotated, inducing high disturbance of equilibrium between the transmit- ter and the disintegrator by triple negative evolution, with the result that a force from five to ten, fifteen, twenty, and thirty thousand pounds to the square inch is evolved by the focalization of this triple negative stream on the disintegrating cell, or chamber, whether there be one, two, three, five, or ten drops of water enclosed within it."

中文: 下一步是在发射器和分解器之间建立纯粹的和谐，这是通过旋转警笛盘来完成的，然后等待，直到达到共鸣音，随着警笛和弦的速度下降，音阶下降。此时，负加速器必须立即快速旋转，通过三重负演变引起传输器和崩解器之间的高度平衡紊乱，结果是，通过将三重负流聚焦在崩解室上，无论其中包有一滴、两滴、三滴、五滴或十滴水，都会产生从五到十、十五、二十和三万磅到平方英寸的力。”

"When moist air is subdivided by atomic vibration, the hydrogen is dissociated or separated from the oxygen but neither of them pass from the intermolecular state. Not until the intermolecular structure of hydrogen is subdivided by interatomic vibrations can it assimilate with the introductory etheric element."

"The latent force from liquids and gases differs from that liberated in metals in that it results from the breaking up of their rotating etheric envelopes, increasing simultaneously the range of their corpuscular action giving under confinement forces of almost infinite variety of pressures. When liberated from the tube it is confined in it seeks its medium of corresponding tenuity with a velocity exceeding that of light."

中文: 液体和气体的潜力与金属释放的潜力不同，因为它是由旋转的以太外壳破裂引起的，同时增加了它们在几乎无限多种压力的约束力下产生的微粒作用范围。当从管中释放出来时，它被限制在其中，以超过光速的速度寻找相应的稀薄介质

"The sympathetic neutral flow (from the molecular neutral centers to the mass neutral center) is the latent power liberated in the disintegration of water. In water this power is dispersive, liberating latent elastic energy, while in metals the latent force manifests itself only in negative attraction and when these vibrations are applied to minerals, there is evolved the primal ether which is dissipated, leaving behind only an impalpable intermolecular dust, in which is contained in virgin form an metals originally in the mineral mass."

中文: 交感中性流（从分子中性中心到质量中性中心）是水分解过程中释放出的势能。在水中，这种势能是分散的，释放出潜在的弹性能，而在金属中，这种势能只表现为负吸引。当这些振动施加到矿物上时，就产生了消散的原始以太，只留下一种摸不着的分子间尘埃，其中以原始形式含有矿物中最初的金属。

A non-intermittent flow of sympathy must flow along the Trexar, consisting of harmoniously adjusted thirds. Differential molecular weight is required, that is, the gas must contain heavy atoms and light atoms. This condition is satisfied by water, which consists of two light atoms of hydrogen and one heavy atom of oxygen. The oxygen atom weighs sixteen times as much as the hydrogen.

一股非间歇性的交感流必须沿着Trexar流动，由和谐调整的三分之一组成。需要不同的分子量，即气体必须包含重原子和轻原子。水满足了这个条件，水由两个氢轻原子和一个氧重原子组成。氧原子的重量是氢原子的十六倍。

It is absolutely necessary to release the molecular ether by reducing the water to the interatomic state, before the atoms within the intermolecules can be released. Also the etheric capsules of the atomic and interatomic must be ruptured before the interatomic force can be produced. The ether from one subdivision is essential to subdividing the next higher.

在分子间的原子被释放之前，绝对有必要通过将水还原到原子间状态来释放分子以太。此外，在产生原子间力之前，原子和原子间的以太胶囊必须破裂。一个细分的以太对于下一个更高的细分是必不可少的。

Keely systemized the proper vibratory chords progressively, from the introductory molecular to the interetheric, embracing seven distinct orders of triple subdivision. He proved to his own satisfaction that progressive subdivision evolves new and distinct elements "too multiple to enumeate."

从入门分子到以太间，逐步地将正确的振动和弦系统化，包括七个不同的三重细分顺序。他满意地证明，渐进细分进化出新的、独特的元素“太多了，无法枚举”

Water is a ready and fit subject for vibratory research on account of its "differential volume" and gravity of its gases. Even on simple thirds the differential action between hydrogen and oxygen causes antagonism and dissociation. The differential of mass is such that the hydrogen and oxygen become thoroughly repellant and thereby exhibit thousands of times more force than could be in- duced by heat on the same amount of water. Vibration of antagonistic thirds, sixths and ninths on the mass chord will compel progressive subdivisions and to get the best effect on water, the instrument is set on all of these. First, the focalizing chord of sixths induces perfect harmony to the mass chord. Then the diatonic scale and enharmonic scale at the top of the instrument (or ring) is harmonized with the scale of the ninths at the base of his Trexar with the telephone transmitter. His next procedure was to disturb the harmony between the transmitter and disintegrator on the concentrative thirds or sixths, by rotating a siren. This he used to induce sympathetic communication along the Trexnonar between the vibrator and disintegrator. When the siren concorded to the neutral center it established the highest order of sympathy. He then operated the "transferable vibratory negatizer" or "vibratory accelerator" in the center of the "diatonic and enharmonic ring" at the top of the disintegrator and complete disintegration followed. The thirds first resolved the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, then the sixths resolved the hydrogen and oxygen into new elements by dissociation, producing "low atomic ether." Then the ninths resolved the low atomic ether into a new element or "high or sec- ond atomic harmonic." All these transmissions were simultaneous on the sympathetic equilibrium being disturbed by the negative accelerator.

Keely's first efforts toward disintegration of the elements of water were successful because of the differential weight of the respective atoms composing its molecules. Subsequently, he discovered that this same method, disintegration by differential mass, may be carried out with any gas, in other words, it must contain heavy atoms and light atoms. The heavy atom or oxygen in water weighs just sixteen times as much as either of the hydrogen atoms to which it is joined by chemical affinity.

"In the dissociation of water, molecular and intermolecular dissociation produces the first order of ozone, which is refreshing and vitalizing to breathe. Atomic and interatomic dissociation produces the second order of ozone, which is too pure to breathe, for it produces insensibility." The third order of ozone, produced by etheric and interetheric dissociation, Keely used in his "carbon register" to produce a high vibratory circuit to break up cohesion, which he recognized as mo- lecular magnetism. It is possible that this "dissociation" in the "carbon register" depolarized the iron molecules by allowing the corpuscular out- reach to return within the molecular embrace. The acceleration of vibration producing these different orders is governed by the introductory impulse and the subsequent chords, as arranged in his Liberator, by which he dissociated water. In molecular dissociation he used one fork of 620, setting chords on the first octave. In atomic separation, he used two forks, one of 620 and one of 630, setting chords on the second octave. In etheric separation he used three forks, one of 620, one of 630 and one of 12,000, setting the chords on the third octave.

"Not until the intermolecular structure of hy- drogen is subdivided by interatomic vibrations, can it assimilate with the introductory etheric element."

Certain differential, dual, triple or quadruple chords act as an introductory impulse exciting action on molecular masses (liquid or gaseous) decreasing molecular oscillation. They are then in a receptive state for vibratory disintegration. The diatonic-enharmonic is sounded, increasing molecular oscillation. Molecular subdivision takes place when oscillation exceeds 50% of their diameters. (Molecular or intermolecular?) The gas is now molecularly subdivided and assumes a high velocity of rotation in any confining container, be it sphere or tube and becomes the medium or prepared subject for further disintegration. At this particular time Keely sought to further excite this preparatory medium by the use of an "illuminated revolving prism" a condenser (concave mirror or convex lens) and colored lenses, thereby giving the vibratory frequencies of their respective colors. In his disintegrator a glass tube of sufficient strength to withstand a pressure of 1000 Ibs. per square inch was arranged leading to the neutral center and the Trexar was attached to the external end of this glass tube. His use of this tube was probably also to convince the skeptics that the production of his power was genuine and possibly also was used to transmit color vibrations of such frequencies as to release the energy in the neutral center of the sphere.

When the triple introductory impulse or chords in three octaves, are transmitted to the disintegrator it SUBSERVES OR RENDERS NON- OPERATIVE THE MOLECULAR CONCORDANT THIRDS AND ANTAGONIZES WITH DISCORDANT THIRDS, extending their range of oscillation and thereby inducing the highest degree of repellant antagonism or repulsion toward the neutral center of the sphere volume.

The etheric dominant or celestial current induces aqueous disintegration and thermal concentra- tion which two prime conductors display a coincident chord of sympathy with the celestial current. These two prime conductors link the terrestrial to the celestial, without which electricity and magnetism would tend to become static or stable, all life and motion are governed by a dual power disturbance of equilibrium and sympathetic equation, both of which are in turn moved and regulated by electricity and magnetism.

Progressive molecular and intermolecular dissociation reproduces on a small scale Nature's system of light production and also invariably results in vortex motion. All corpuscular action in Nature is vortex motion. The vortex action between the terrestrial and celestial streams, terrestrial condensation against solar tensions, shows conditions analogous to those displayed in the dissociation of water into hydrogen and oxygen, that is, vortex motion of the highest order, but peripheral only.

EXAMPLE OF DISINTEGRATION

If the mass chord of the disintegrator is B flat, the resonators of that structure are set at B flat first octave, B flat third octave and B flat ninth octave, by drawing out the resonator caps and clamping the set screws. A simple movement of the fingers on the diatonic scale at the head will determine by the tremulous action of the caps when exactly resonant. Neutral focalization is then established by dampening the steel rods on the back of the scale representing thirds, sixths, and ninths, by drawing a piece of small gum tube over them, which establishes harmony to the mass chord of the instrument. This effects con- cordance between the disintegrator and the ninths of the scale at baseof transmitter with telephone head.

This instrument had a universal accommodator for all ninths in all multiple variations. This was possibly his sphere resonator.

Concordant harmony must now be established between the transmitter and the disintegrator by spinning the siren disk and waiting for the sympa- thetic note as its velocity decreases. As soon as this note sounds, the negative accelerator must be rapidly rotated inducing high disturbance of equilibrium between the disintegrator and the transmitter by triple negative evolution resulting in enormous pressure. By triple negative evolution he doubtless means disintegration to the etheric stage.
