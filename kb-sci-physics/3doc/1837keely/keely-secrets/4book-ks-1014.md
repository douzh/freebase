Theory and Formula of Aqueous Disintegration (by John Keely)

The peculiar conditions as associated with the gaseous elements of which water is composed, as regards the differential volume and gravity of its gases, make it a ready and fit subject of vibratory research. In submitting water to the influence of vibratory transmission, even on simple thirds, the high action induced on the hydrogen as contrasted with the one on the oxygen (under the same vibratory stream) causes the antagonism between these elements that induces dissociation. The dif- ferential antagonistic range of motion, so favoring the antagonistic thirds as to become thoroughly repellant. The gaseous element thus induced and registered, shows thousands of times much greater force as regards tenuity and volume than that induced by the chemical disintegration of heat, on the same medium. In all molecular disso- ciation or disintegration of both simple and com- pound elements, whether gaseous or solid, a stream of vibratory antagonistic thirds, sixths, or ninths, on their chord mass will compel progres- sive subdivisions. In the disintegration of water the instrument is set on thirds, sixths, and ninths, to get the best effects. These triple conditions are focalized on the neutral center of said instrument so as to induce perfect harmony or concordance to the chord note of the mass chord of the instru- ments full combination, after which the diatonic and the enharmonic scale located at the top of the instrument, or ring, is thoroughly harmonized with the scale of ninths which is placed at the base of the vibratory transmitter with the telephone head. The next step is to disturb the harmony on the concentrative thirds, between the trans- mitter and the disintegrator. This is done by rotating the siren so as to induce a sympathetic communication along the nodal transmitter, or wire, that associates the two instruments. When the note of the siren becomes concordant to the neutral center of the disintegrator, the highest order of sympathetic communication is established. It is now necessary to operate the transferable vi- bratory negatizer or negative accelerator, which is seated in the center of the diatonic and enharmonic ring, at the top of the disintegrator, and complete disintegration will follow (from the an- tagonisms induced on the concordants by said ad- junct)in triple progression, thus: First thirds: Molecular dissociation resolving the water into a gaseous compound of hydrogen and oxygen. Sec- ond: sixths, resolving the hydrogen and oxygen into a new element by second order of dissociation, producing what I call low atomic ether. Third: ninths, the low atomic ether resolved into a new element, which I denominate high or sec- ond atomic harmonic. All these transmissions being simultaneous on the disturbance of sympa- thetic equilibrium by said negative accelerator.

EXAMPLE:

Taking the chord mass of the disintegrator B flat, or any chord mass that may be represented by the combined association of all the mechanical parts of its structure (no two structures being alike in their chord masses) taking B flat, the resonators of said structure are set at B flat first octave, B flat third octave and B flat ninth octave by drawing out the caps of resonators until the harmony of thirds, sixths, and ninths are reached; which is simple movement of the fingers on the diatonic scale, at the head, will determine by the tremulous action which is highly sensible to the touch, on said caps. The caps are then rigidly fixed in their different positions by set screws. The focalization to the neutral center is then established by dampening the steel rods, on the back of the scale, representing the thirds, sixths and ninths, drawing a piece of small gum tube over them, which establishes harmony to the chord mass of the instrument. Concordance is thus effected betweenthe disintegrator and the ninths of the scale at base of transmitters with telephonic head.

This scale has a permanent sympathetic one, set on the ninth of any mass chord that may be represented, on any and all the multiple variations of mechanical combinations. In fact, permanently set for universal accommodations.

The next step is to establish pure harmony between the transmitter and the disintegrator, which is done by spinning the siren disk, then waiting until the sympathetic note is reached, as the siren chord, decreasing in velocity, descends the scale. At this juncture, the negative accelerator must be immediately and rapidly rotated, inducing high disturbance of equilibrium between the transmit- ter and the disintegrator by triple negative evolution, with the result that a force from five to ten, fifteen, twenty, and thirty thousand pounds to the square inch is evolved by the focalization of this triple negative stream on the disintegrating cell, or chamber, whether there be one, two, three, five, or ten drops of water enclosed within it."

"When moist air is subdivided by atomic vibration, the hydrogen is dissociated or separated from the oxygen but neither of them pass from the intermolecular state. Not until the intermolecular structure of hydrogen is subdivided by interatomic vibrations can it assimilate with the introductory etheric element."


"The latent force from liquids and gases differs from that liberated in metals in that it results from the breaking up of their rotating etheric envelopes, increasing simultaneously the range of their corpuscular action giving under confinement forces of almost infinite variety of pressures. When liberated from the tube it is confined in it seeks its medium of corresponding tenuity with a velocity exceeding that of light."

"The sympathetic neutral flow (from the molecular neutral centers to the mass neutral center) is the latent power liberated in the disintegration of water. In water this power is dispersive, liberating latent elastic energy, while in metals the latent force manifests itself only in negative attraction and when these vibrations are applied to minerals, there is evolved the primal ether which is dissipated, leaving behind only an impalpable intermolecular dust, in which is contained in virgin form an metals originally in the mineral mass."

A non-intermittent flow of sympathy must flow along the Trexar, consisting of harmoniously adjusted thirds. Differential molecular weight is required, that is, the gas must contain heavy atoms and light atoms. This condition is satisfied by water, which consists of two light atoms of hydrogen and one heavy atom of oxygen. The oxygen atom weighs sixteen times as much as the hydrogen.

It is absolutely necessary to release the molecular ether by reducing the water to the interatomic state, before the atoms within the intermolecules can be released. Also the etheric capsules of the atomic and interatomic must be ruptured before the interatomic force can be produced. The ether from one subdivision is essential to subdividing the next higher.

Keely systemized the proper vibratory chords progressively, from the introductory molecular to the interetheric, embracing seven distinct orders of triple subdivision. He proved to his own satisfaction that progressive subdivision evolves new and distinct elements "too multiple to enumeate."

Water is a ready and fit subject for vibratory research on account of its "differential volume" and gravity of its gases. Even on simple thirds the differential action between hydrogen and oxygen causes antagonism and dissociation. The differential of mass is such that the hydrogen and oxygen become thoroughly repellant and thereby exhibit thousands of times more force than could be in- duced by heat on the same amount of water. Vi- bration of antagonistic thirds, sixths and ninths on the mass chord will compel progressive subdivisions and to get the best effect on water, the instrument is set on all of these. First, the focalizing chord of sixths induces perfect harmony to the mass chord. Then the diatonic scale and enhar- monic scale at the top of the instrument (or ring) is harmonized with the scale of the ninths at the base of his Trexar with the telephone transmitter. His next procedure was to disturb the harmony between the transmitter and disintegrator on the concentrative thirds or sixths, by rotating a siren. This he used to induce sympathetic communication along the Trexnonar between the vibrator and disintegrator. When the siren concorded to the neutral center it established the highest order of sympathy. He then operated the "transferable vibratory negatizer" or "vibratory accelerator" in the center of the "diatonic and enharmonic ring" at the top of the disintegrator and complete disintegration followed. The thirds first resolved the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, then the sixths resolved the hydrogen and oxygen into new elements by dissociation, producing "low atomic ether." Then the ninths resolved the low atomic ether into a new element or "high or sec- ond atomic harmonic." All these transmissions were simultaneous on the sympathetic equilibrium being disturbed by the negative accelerator.

Keely's first efforts toward disintegration of the elements of water were successful because of the differential weight of the respective atoms composing its molecules. Subsequently, he discovered that this same method, disintegration by differential mass, may be carried out with any gas, in other words, it must contain heavy atoms and light atoms. The heavy atom or oxygen in water weighs just sixteen times as much as either of the hydrogen atoms to which it is joined by chemical affinity.

"In the dissociation of water, molecular and intermolecular dissociation produces the first order of ozone, which is refreshing and vitalizing to breathe. Atomic and interatomic dissociation produces the second order of ozone, which is too pure to breathe, for it produces insensibility." The third order of ozone, produced by etheric and interetheric dissociation, Keely used in his "carbon register" to produce a high vibratory circuit to break up cohesion, which he recognized as mo- lecular magnetism. It is possible that this "dissociation" in the "carbon register" depolarized the iron molecules by allowing the corpuscular out- reach to return within the molecular embrace. The acceleration of vibration producing these different orders is governed by the introductory impulse and the subsequent chords, as arranged in his Liberator, by which he dissociated water. In molecular dissociation he used one fork of 620, setting chords on the first octave. In atomic separation, he used two forks, one of 620 and one of 630, setting chords on the second octave. In etheric separation he used three forks, one of 620, one of 630 and one of 12,000, setting the chords on the third octave.

"Not until the intermolecular structure of hy- drogen is subdivided by interatomic vibrations, can it assimilate with the introductory etheric element."

Certain differential, dual, triple or quadruple chords act as an introductory impulse exciting action on molecular masses (liquid or gaseous) decreasing molecular oscillation. They are then in a receptive state for vibratory disintegration. The diatonic-enharmonic is sounded, increasing molecular oscillation. Molecular subdivision takes place when oscillation exceeds 50% of their diameters. (Molecular or intermolecular?) The gas is now molecularly subdivided and assumes a high velocity of rotation in any confining container, be it sphere or tube and becomes the medium or prepared subject for further disintegration. At this particular time Keely sought to further excite this preparatory medium by the use of an "illuminated revolving prism" a condenser (concave mirror or convex lens) and colored lenses, thereby giving the vibratory frequencies of their respective colors. In his disintegrator a glass tube of sufficient strength to withstand a pressure of 1000 Ibs. per square inch was arranged leading to the neutral center and the Trexar was attached to the external end of this glass tube. His use of this tube was probably also to convince the skeptics that the production of his power was genuine and possibly also was used to transmit color vibrations of such frequencies as to release the energy in the neutral center of the sphere.

When the triple introductory impulse or chords in three octaves, are transmitted to the disintegrator it SUBSERVES OR RENDERS NON- OPERATIVE THE MOLECULAR CONCORDANT THIRDS AND ANTAGONIZES WITH DISCORDANT THIRDS, extending their range of oscillation and thereby inducing the highest degree of repellant antagonism or repulsion toward the neutral center of the sphere volume.

The etheric dominant or celestial current induces aqueous disintegration and thermal concentra- tion which two prime conductors display a coincident chord of sympathy with the celestial current. These two prime conductors link the terrestrial to the celestial, without which electricity and magnetism would tend to become static or stable, all life and motion are governed by a dual power disturbance of equilibrium and sympathetic equation, both of which are in turn moved and regulated by electricity and magnetism.

Progressive molecular and intermolecular dissociation reproduces on a small scale Nature's system of light production and also invariably results in vortex motion. All corpuscular action in Nature is vortex motion. The vortex action between the terrestrial and celestial streams, terrestrial condensation against solar tensions, shows conditions analogous to those displayed in the dissociation of water into hydrogen and oxygen, that is, vortex motion of the highest order, but peripheral only.

EXAMPLE OF DISINTEGRATION

If the mass chord of the disintegrator is B flat, the resonators of that structure are set at B flat first octave, B flat third octave and B flat ninth octave, by drawing out the resonator caps and clamping the set screws. A simple movement of the fingers on the diatonic scale at the head will determine by the tremulous action of the caps when exactly resonant. Neutral focalization is then established by dampening the steel rods on the back of the scale representing thirds, sixths, and ninths, by drawing a piece of small gum tube over them, which establishes harmony to the mass chord of the instrument. This effects con- cordance between the disintegrator and the ninths of the scale at baseof transmitter with telephone head.

This instrument had a universal accommodator for all ninths in all multiple variations. This was possibly his sphere resonator.

Concordant harmony must now be established between the transmitter and the disintegrator by spinning the siren disk and waiting for the sympa- thetic note as its velocity decreases. As soon as this note sounds, the negative accelerator must be rapidly rotated inducing high disturbance of equilibrium between the disintegrator and the transmitter by triple negative evolution resulting in enormous pressure. By triple negative evolution he doubtless means disintegration to the etheric stage.
