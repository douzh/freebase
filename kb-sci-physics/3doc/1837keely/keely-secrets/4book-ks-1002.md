Etheric Force Identified as Dynaspheric Force (by Mrs. Clara Jessup Bloomfield-Moore)

"Science is to know things."

"It may be said that if all things come from only one cause or internal source, acting within itself, then motion and matter must be fundamentally and essentially one and the same, and we look upon matter as being latent force and upon force as being free matter. "

Franz Hartmann, M.D.

JOHN WORRELL KEELY--the discoverer of compound inter-etheric force, as operating in the animal organism, man is a great thinker, and a great student of the capabilities of nature in offering to man's intelligence the means whereby he may discover for himself the secrets she often veils without entirely concealing.

The result of more than twenty years of persistent effort to apply this force to the operation of machinery has, at last, been enabled to produce continuity of motion in his engine; but, up to this time, he has not so mastered this subtle force as to control reversions. The development of his various discov- eries has been one uninterrupted work of evolution, reaching, within the last year, he thinks, the sphere of perfect vi- bratory sympathy, both theoretically and practically. The proof of this is found in the fact that he now transmits vibrations along a wire, connected at one end with the vibratory machine which is the source of power, and at the other end with the engine or cannon, as
the case may be, which is operated by such vibratory power. Until recently, comparatively speaking. Keely stored force, as he generated it, in a receiver; and experiments were made by him in the presence of thousands, at various times, for the purpose of testing the op- erations of this force, liberated in the presence of his audience and stored up in this small receiver. The editor of the Scientific Arena thus describes what took place at one of these exhibitions, when he was present: --"The confined vapor was passed through one of the small flexible tubes to a steel cylinder on another table, in which a vertical piston was fitted so that its upper end bore against the underside of a powerful weighted lever. The superficial area of this piston was equal to one-half of a square inch, and it acted as a movable fulcrum placed close to the hinged end of the short arm of this lever, whose weight alone required a pressure of 1,500 pounds to the square inch against the piston to lift it.

After testing the pressure by several small weights, added to that of the lever itself, in order to determine how much power had already been accumulated in the receiver, the maximum test was made by placing an iron weight of 580 pounds, by means of a differential pul- ley, on the extreme end of the long arm of the lever. To lift this weight, without that of the lever supporting it, would re- quire a pressure against the piston of 18,900 pounds to the square inch, counting the difference in the length of the two arms and the area of the pis- ton, which we, as well as several others present, accurately calculated. When all was ready, and the crowded gather- ing had formed as well as possible to see the test, Keely turned the valve-wheel leading from the receiver to the flexible tube, and through it into the steel cylinder beneath the piston, and simultaneously with the motion of his hand the weighted lever shot up against its stop, a distance of several inches, as if the great mass of iron had been only a cork. Then, in order to assure our- selves of the full 25,000 pounds to the square inch claimed, we added most of our weight to the arm of the lever with- out forcing the piston back again.

After repeating this experiment till all expressed themselves satisfied, Kee- ly diverted his etheric gas to the exciting work of firing a cannon, into which he placed a leaden bullet about an inch in diameter. He conveyed the force from the receiver by the same kind of flexible copper tube, attaching at one end of it to the breech of the gun. When all was again in readiness he gave a quick turn to the inlet valve, and a report like that of a small cannon followed, the ball passing through an inch board and flattening itself out to about three inches in diameter, showing the marvelous power and instantaneous action of this strange vapor.

The difficulty encountered by Keely in his old generator of etheric force grew out of the fact, in part, that the vaporic power produced was so humid that he could not, when he attempted to utilize it, obtain its theoretical value in work. This difficulty has been entire- ly overcome by dispensing with the wa- ter which he used in liberating etheric force, by his old generator; and, by this departure, he has attained a success beyond that which we anticipated by himself, when he abandoned his origi- nal line of experiment. Ignorant, in- deed, of the nature of Keely's work must those men be who accuse him of "abandoning his base" or "principle," each time that he discovers his mis- takes: --using them as stepping-stones to approach nearer and still nearer to his goal. Reproaching him, even, for keeping his own counsel, until certainty of success rendered it prudent for him to make known that he had changed his field of experiment from positive attraction to negative attraction, he had succeeded in his efforts to produce continuity of motion. Equally ignorant are those, who would wrench by force his secrets from him before the time is ripe for their disclosure. Let us suppose that Faraday, when he discovered radiant matter in 1816, had formed a "Faraday Phospho-Genetic Radiant Company,"to enable him to experiment: fully cogni- zant of all that Crookes has since dis- covered, and had taken for his base in experimenting the principle involved in Crookes' discovery. Not succeeding at first, we will suppose that the Company became clamorous for returns, and de- manded that his secret principle should be made public. Had he been driven into making known, who would have credited what Crookes is now able to prove? The effect would have been upon the Faraday Company the same as if a balloon were punctured just as it was soaring heavenward. The same with the Keely Motor Company, had Keely obeyed the order of the Court in 1882, and made his marvelous secret public. It would have collapsed. Therefore, he has maintained his secret in the inter- ests of the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company with a firmness worthy of a Christian martyr. The one person to whom alone Keely then disclosed it thought him under a delusion, until he had demonstrated its soundness. When he said, in all solemnity, "Now, I feel as if you and I were the god and goddess of this world," the effect upon the hear- er was no more than it would have been had a patient in a hospital for the in- sane spoken the words. Charles B. Col- lier, Keely's patent lawyer, writes as fol- lows, concerning the difficulties attendant upon "the supposed duty" of his client's imparting his "secrets," as ordered by the Court to do, some time since: ---

If to-day, for the first time in your lives, you saw a harp attuned and being played upon, you would hardly expect, without considerable time and study, to be able to reproduce the harp, attune its strings in proper relation to each other, and to play upon it so as to pro- duce the harmonies which you had lis- tened to. Mr. Keely's work is analogous to the illustration which I have presented, inasmuch as he is dealing with the subject of sound, or acoustics, but in a much more involved form than as ap- plied simply for the production of har- monies for the delight of the ear. Mr. Keely's engine is analogous to the mechanism of the human ear, in the re- spect that it is a structure operated upon, and its notion induced by vibration; and to the end of securing and at- taining, in and by it, uniformity or reg- ularity of motion, there must be perfect unison or synchronism, as between it and his structure which is the prime source of vibration. To attain this per- fect unison or synchronism, has in- volved unparalleled research and exper- iment upon his part--experiments that have varied from day to day. No one, in my opinion, who had not stood by his side, as his shadow, watching every ex- periment, could have kept fully abreast of him. To pursue my simile, I may say that his harp (engine) is not yet perfect- ly attuned ("graduated"); when it is so, it will produce nothing but harmony (regularity of motion), and his work will
be finished.

At such time, I doubt not that he will be able to give to Mr. Boekel, myself or another, the scale with which to re- construct and attune another appara- tus so as to produce like results with it; but to go over the ground that he has gone over, to explore the wilderness in which he has been the pioneer, in other words, the study, to a full understand- ing of them, of his experiments and re- searches, as recorded in his writings and illustrated in the beautiful charts which he has produced, will be a work rather for scientists than for mechani- cians or engineers

Mr. Keely's "Theoretical Expose" is in preparation for the press; and, when these volumes are issued, we may look for a change of attitude towards him in all men who hold themselves ready to abandon preconceived notions, however cherished, if they be found to contradict truths; which, Herbert Spencer says, is the first condition of success in scientif- ic research. The Rev. J. J. Smith, M.A., D.D., tells us that the only way the great problem of the universe can ever be scientifically solved is by studying, and arriving at just conclusions with regard to the true nature and character of force. This has been Mr. Keely's life study; and he is able to demonstrate all that he asserts.

The author of No. 5 of the pamph- lets issued by The Theosophical Publi- cation Society, "What is Matter and What is Force, " says therein, "The men of science have just found out 'a fourth state of matter,' whereas the occultists have penetrated years ago beyond the sixth, and therefore do not infer, but know of, the existence of the seventh, the last. "This knowledge comprises one of the secrets of Keely's so-called "com- pound secret." It is already known to many that his secret includes "the aug- mentation of energy. "the insulation of the ether," and the "adaptation of dy- naspheric force to machinery."

Laurence Oliphant writes: Recent scientific research has proved conclu- sively that all force is atomic -- that electricity consists of files of particles, and that the interstellar spaces contain substances, whether it be called ether or astral fluid (or by any other name), which is composed of atoms, because it is not possible to dissever force from its transmitting medium. The whole uni- verse, therefore, and all that it con- tains, consists of matter in motion, and is animated by a vital principle which we call God.

"Science has further discovered that these atoms are severally encompassed by an ethereal substance which pre- vents their touching each other, and to this circumambient, inter-atomic ele- ment they have given the name of dyna- sphere; but, inasmuch as has further been found, that in these dynaspheres there resides a tremendous potency, it is evident that they also must contain atoms, and that these atoms must in their turn be surrounded by dyna- spheres, which again contain atoms, and so on ad infinitum. Matter thus be- comes infinite and indestructible, and the force which pervades it persistent and everlasting.

"This dynaspheric force, which is also called etheric, is conditioned as to its nature on the quality of the atoms which form its transmitting media; and which are infinite both in variety and in their combinations. They may, however, be broadly divided into two categories; viz. the sentient and the non-sentient atoms. Dynaspheric force, composed of non-sentient atoms, is the force that has been already mechanically applied by Mr. Keely to his motor; and which will probably ere long supersede the agencies now used for locomotive, pro- jectile, and other purposes. When the laws which govern it come to be under- stood, it will produce materially a great commercial and industrial revolution. There is no hard and fast line between the animal and vegetable creation, so there is a graduated scale of atoms, between which although animated by the divine life are not sentient, and those which are as highly developed, relatively to them, as man is to a cabbage."

"The most remarkable illustration of the stupendous energy of atomic vibra- tory force is to be found in that singular apparatus in Philadelphia -- which for the last fifteen years has excited in turn the amazement, the skepticism, the ad- miration, and the ridicule of those who have examined it -- called 'Keely's Mo- tor.".. "in the practical land of its ori- gin, it has popularly been esteemed a fraud. I have not examined it personal- ly, but I believe it to be based upon a sound principle of dynamics, and to be probably the first of a series of discover- ies destined to revolutionize all existing mechanical theories, and many of the principles upon which they are found- ed. Those who are sufficiently unpreju- diced to connect the bearings of this discovery, of what must be dynaspheric force, with phenomena which have hitherto been regarded as supernatural by the ignorant, will perceive how rap- idly we are bridging over the chasm which has divided the seen from the unseen, obliterating the distinction be- tween 'matter' and what has most erroneously been called 'spirit."

In 1882 a woman, coversing with Mr. Keely, said, "You have opened the door into the spirit world." He answered, "do you think so? I have sometimes though I might be able to discov- er the origin of life." At this time Mr. Keely had given no attention whatever to the occult bearing of his discovery; and it was only after he had pursued his researches, under the advantages which his small Liberator afforded him for such experiments, that he realized the truth of this women's assertion. It was then, in 1887, that a "bridge of mist" formed itself before him, connect- ing the laws which govern physical sci- ence with the laws which govern spiri- tual science, and year by year this bridge of mist has solidified, until now he is in a position to stand upon it, and proclaim that its abutments have a sol- id foundation -- one resting in the ma- terial and visible world, and the other in the spiritual and unseen world; or, rather, that no bridge is needed to con- nect the two worlds, one law governing both in its needed modifications.

"The physical thing," writes a mod- ern scientist, "which energizes and does work in and upon ordinary matter, is a separate form of matter, infinitely re- fined, and infinitely rapid in its vibra- tions, and is thus able to penetrate through all ordinary matter, and to make everywhere a fountain of motion, no less real because unseen. It is among the atoms of the crystal and the molecules of living matter; and, wheth- er producing locked effects or free, it is the same cosmic thing, matter in mo- tion, which we conceive as material en- ergy, and with difficulty think of as only a peculiar form of matter in motion."

Oliphant, commenting upon this view of energy, says: "This is nothing more or less than what we have been in the habit of calling 'spirit.". "Mind is also composed of this extraordinary matter; so is will; so is every emotion." Jacob Boehme calls it "heavenly substantiality," and Swendenborg calls it "natural and spiritual atmospheres, composed of discrete substances of a very minute form." Professor Crookes has invented the word "protyle." Profes- sor Cones calls it "soul-stuff," or biogen; while Occultists call it "astral fluid."

To all who are conversant with Mr. Keely's theories a similarity of views will be evident.

The President of the British Associa- tion, Sir Henry Roscoe, in his address before that body, said: "In nature there is no such thing as great or small; the structure of the smallest particle, invisible even to our most searching vision, may be as complicated as that of any of the heavenly bodies which circle round our sun." As to the indivisibility of the atom, he asks this question: "Notwith- standing the properties of these ele- ments have been studied, and are now known with a degree of precision for- merly undreamt of, have the atoms of our present elements been made to yield?" He continues: "A negative an- swer must undoubtedly be given, for even the highest of terrestrial temperatures, that of the electric spark, has failed to shake any one of these atoms in two."

This is an error, for it is well known by those who are fully acquainted with the principle involved in Keely's inven- tions that the intense vibratory action which is induced in his "Liberator" has accomplished what the retort of the chemist has failed to do, what the elec- tric spark has left intact, and what the inconceivably fierce temperature of the sun and the volcanic fires has turned over to us unscathed. The mighty Genii imprisoned within the molecule, thus released from the chains and fetters which Nature forged, has been for years the the tyrant of the one who rashly in- truded, without first paving the way with the gold which he has since been accused of using in experiments with reckless and wanton waste! For more than a score of years has Keely been fighting a hand-to-hand fight with this Genii; often beaten back by it, paralyzed at times, even, by its monstrous blows; and only now so approaching its subjugations as to make it safe to har- ness it for the work that is calling for a power mightier than steam, safer and more uniform in operation than elec- tricity; a power which, by its might and beneficence, will ameliorate the condition of the masses, and reconcile and solve all that now menaces our race; as it was never menaced before, as has been said.

The structure of the air molecule, as believed in by Keely, is as follows: -- Broken up, by vibratory action, he finds it to contain what he calls an atomic triplet. The position of a molecule, on the point of a fine cambric needle sustains the same relation to the point of the needle that a grain of sand sustains to a field of ten acres.

Although, as Sir H. Roscoe has said, "In nature there is no such thing as great or small," the human mind can- not conceive such infinitesimal minute- ness. We will, then, imagine a molecule magnified to the size of a billiard ball, and the atomic triplet magnified to the size of three marbles, in the triangular position, within that molecule, at its center; unless acted upon by electricity, when the molecule, the billiard ball, be- comes oblate, and the three atoms are ranged in a line within, unless broken up by the mighty force of vibratory ac- tion. Nature never gives us a vacuum; consequently, the space within the molecule not occupied by the atomic triplet must be filled with something. This is where the Genii- "the all- prevading ether"--has made its secret abode through untold eons, during which our world has been in course of preparation for its release, to fulfill its appointed task in advancing the progress of the human race.

Step by step, with patient perseverance which some day the world will honour, this man of genius has made his researches, overcoming the colossal difficulties which have raised up in his path what seemed to be insurmounta- ble barriers to further progress: but never before has the world's index fin- ger so pointed to an hour when all is making ready for the advent of the new form of force that mankind is waiting for. Nature, always reluctant to yield her secrets, is listening to the demands made upon her by her master, necessi- ty. The coal mines of the world cannot long afford the increasing drain made upon them. Steam has reached its ut- most limits of power, and does not ful- fill the requirements of the age. Elec- tricity holds back, with bated breath, dependent upon the approach of her sister colleague. Air ships are riding at anchor, as it were, waiting for the force which is to make aerial navigation something more than a dream. As easi- ly as men communicate with their offic- es from their homes by means of the telephone, so will the inhabitants of separate continents talk across the ocean. Imagination is palsied when seeking to foresee the grand results of this marvelous discovery when once it is applied to art and mechanics. In tak- ing the throne which it will force steam to abdicate, dynaspheric force will rule the world with a power so mighty in the interests of civilization, that no finite mind can conjecture the results. Laur- ence Oliphant, in his preface to "Scien- tific Religion," says: "A new moral fu- ture is dawning upon the human race- one, certainly, of which it stands much in need." In no way could this new mo- ral future be so widely, so universally, commenced as by the utilizing of dy- naspheric force to beneficial purposes in life, thus revealing to all men another phase of God's "underlying purpose."

In 1746, when Franklin's attention was drawn to the phenomena of elec- tricity, little more was known on the subject than Thales had announced two thousand years before. Von Kleist in Leyden, Collinson in London, and others in as widely-separated cities in Europe, were experimenting in the same field of research. What our last century has done toward subduing this tyrant which Franklin succeeded in bringing down to earth, from the clouds, the next century will see sur- passed beyond man's widest conjec- tures, should Keely's utilization of this unknown force of nature bestow upon humanity the costless motive power, which he anticipates it will. Reynolds predicted that those who "studied the mysteries of molecular vibration would win the victorious wreaths of successful discovery." After such discoveries as Mr. Keely has made in this field of re- search, it matters not to him whether he succeeds commercially or not. His work of discovery commenced when, as a boy of twelve, he held the seashells to his ear as he walked the shore and not- ed that no two gave forth the same tone. From the construction of his first crude instrument, his work of evolution progressed slowly for years; but within the last five years he has made giant strides towards the "Dark Tower" which is his last fortress to take. When he is ready, "Dauntless the slug-horn to his lips" he will set; and the world will hear the blast, and awaken from its slumber into new life.

Molecular vibration is thus seen to be Keely's legitimate field of research; but more than once has he had to tear down portions of the vibratory scaffold- ing which aided him in the building up of his edifice of philosophy; therefore, he is ever ready to admit that some of the present scaffolding may have to be removed. The charge of "abandoning his base," recently brought against him by one of the editors of The New York Times, could only have been made by one who is utterly ignorant of the sub- ject upon which he writes. Under the heading "A Cool Confession," this editor asserts that Keely has "given up the Keely Motor as a bad job," and that he admits that he is a "bogus inventor" and a "fraud." This is not true.

What Keely does admit is that, baf- fled in applying vibratory force to mechanics, upon his first and second lines of experimental research, he was obliged either to confess a commercial failure, or to try a third departure from his base or principle; seeking success through another channel of experiment. While experimenting upon this third line, until his efforts were crowned with success, he kept his secret from all men; with the approbation of the one who furnished the money for these ex- periments. There is a time when silence is golden; and the charge made by the same editor that Keely had been "receiving money from the Keely Motor Company on false pretences from the time that he abandoned his original plans," could only have been made by one who knows nothing of the facts of the case: for years have passed away since the Keely Motor Company broke its contract with him, and since it has furnished him with any money for his experiments.

But let Keely speak for himself in reference to his work: - "In considering the operation of my engine, the visitor, in order to have even an approximate con- ception of its modus operandi, must dis- card all thought of engines that are oper- ated upon the principle of pressure and exhaustion, by the expansion of steam or other analogous gas which impinges upon an abutment, such as the piston of a steam-engine. My engine has neither piston nor eccentrics, nor is there one grain of pressure exerted in the engine, whatever may be the size or capacity of it.

"My system, in every part and detail, both in the developing of this power and in every branch of its utilization, is based and founded on sympathetic vi- bration. In no other way would it be pos- sible to awaken or develop this force, and equally impossible would it be to op- erate my engine upon any other principle.

"All that remains to be done is to se- cure a uniform speed under different velocities and control reversions. That I shall accomplish this is absolutely certain. Some few years ago, I contemplat- ed using a wire as a connective link between two sympathetic mediums, to evolve this power as also to operate my
machinery -- instead of tubular connections as heretofore employed -- I have recently succeeded in accomplishing successfully such change. This, however, is the true system; and henceforth all my operations will be conducted in this manner-that is to say, the power will be generated, my engines run, my cannon operated, through a wire.

"It has been only after years of incessant labour, and the making of al- most enumerable experiments, involving not only the construction of a great many most peculiar mechanical structures, and the closest investigation and study of the phenomenal properties of the substance "ether," per se, produced, that I have been able to dispense with complicated mechanism, and to obtain, as I claim, mastery over the subtle and strange force with which I am dealing.

"When my present process of ad- justment is completed, the force, the mechanism, and all that pertains to it, will be explained in a theoretical exposi- tion of the subject, with appropriate dia- grams, which I shall publish to the world; through the medium, and my pat- ents, when taken out, a knowledge of all that is required for its commercial em- ployment will be more easily acquired than is the necessary skill required to enable one to safely operate a steam- engine.
"My power will be adapted to en- gines of all sizes and capacities, as well to an engine capable of propelling the largest ship as to one that will operate a sewing machine. Equally well and cer- tain is it that it will be adapted as a pro- jectile force for guns and cannons of all sizes, from the ordinary shoulder-piece to the heaviest artillery."

When Keely in 1887 obtained conti- nuity of motion (for a time) in his en- gine he thought that his last difficulty had been overcome: but, up to the present time, he has not succeeded in governing its speed nor in controlling reversions. He has, however, again re- duced in size the instrument with which he produces force. From 1882 to 1884 the "Generator" was a structure six feet long and correspondingly wide and high; but, failing in his attempt to make an automatic arrangement upon which its usefulness in mechanics depended, Keely found a new standard for research in an experiment often made by himself, but never before successful, which resulted in the production of a machine in 1885 which he named a "Liberator"- not so large as a lady's small round work-table. Continuing his labor of evolution Keely within one year made such astonishing progress, from experiments with this beautiful piece of vibratory mechanism, as to combine the production of the power, and the operation of the cannon, his engine and his disintegrator in a machine no larger than a dinner plate, and only three or four inches in thickness. This instru- ment was completed in 1886, up to which time his experiments had been conducted upon a principle of sympa- thetic vibration, for the purpose of liberating a vapour or etheric product. His later experiments have been confined to another modification of the vibratory sympathy; and the size of the instrument used now, '88, for the same pur- poses is no larger than an old- fashioned silver watch, such as we see in Museum collections. The raising of a lever with an apparent uplifting expan- sive force of between 20,000 and 30,000 pounds to the square inch, the running of the engine, the firing of the cannon, are conducted without one ounce of pressure in any part of the ap- paratus, and without the production or presence of what has been known as Keely's ether. The force is now trans- mitted along a wire (of platinum and silver), and when the lever is lowered there is no exhaustion, into the atmos- phere of the room, of any up-lifting va- por, as was always the case when ether was used in this experiment; nor is there any vapor impinging upon the piston under the lever to raise it.

Mr. Keely has named this new modification of the one force in nature "Negative Attraction," which to the un- initiated does not suggest as much as it would had he called it "Exploded Humbug."

The two forms of force which he has been experimenting with, and the phe- nomena attending them, are the very antithesis of each other. Keely does not feel the shadow of a doubt as to his eventual success in producing engines of varying capacities; small enough, on the one hand, to operate sewing ma- chines with, and large enough, on the other hand, to propel the largest ships that plough the seas. Every fact and feature surrounding the case warrants the belief, notwithstanding the incre- dulity of all who have not witnessed the progress of Mr. Keely, step by step, that his success will be complete, and his work stand as the most colossal exam- ple of the survival of the fittest, in the process of inventive evolution. Cox says: "not one of the great facts which science now accepts as incontrovertible truths but was vehemently denied by the scientists of its time: --declared to be a priori impossible, its discoverers and supporters denounced as fools and charlatans, and even investigation of it refused as being a waste of time and thought." "History repeats itself," and Amiel's definition of science gives the key to the incredulity of scientists in reference to Mr. Keely's discovery; for if, as Amiel has said, "science is a lucid madness occupied with tabulating its own hallucinations," it is not strange that men of science should refuse to in- vestigate what they consider the hallu- cinations of others.

It is an undisputed fact that "too much has been conceded to science, too little to those sublime laws which make science possible."But the one law which regulates creation, and to which all other laws are made subservient, keeping in harmony the systems upon systems of worlds throughout space, developing sound and colour, animal and vegetable growth, the crystalliza- tion of minerals, is the hidden law, which develops every natural science throughout the universe; and which both Kepler and Newton anticipated would be revealed in our age. "You can even trace the poles in sound," writes Mrs. F. J. Hughes, a niece of Darwin, in her work upon the "Evolution of Tones and Colours." The experiments made by Mrs. Watts Hughes, at the annual Reception of the Royal Society, and the Pendulograph* writings by Andrew of Belfast, have a bearing upon Keely's discovery; illustrating the workings of this hidden law of nature.
