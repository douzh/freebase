Chapter 2 GYROSCOPIC ACTIONS

"The way in which Faraday made use of his lines of force in coordinating the phenomena of electric induction shows him to have been a mathematician of high order, and one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods."

-James Clerk Maxwell

法拉第用力线表示电感应现象展示了他已经是一个有很高水平的数学家，未来的数学家可能从他的方法中得到宝贵和丰富的方法。

-麦克斯韦

I will begin with the scientific facts concerning my initial reading in March, 1965 on the nature of Michael Faraday's Generator.

我将从我在1965年3月开始读的迈克尔-法拉第的发电机中的科学事实开始。

Anyone who cannot recognize the veracity of certain conclusions that I understood when I initially studied Faraday's facts has been unjustly influenced by the teaching process which rewards one for memorization and discourages questioning of the subject matter taught.

所有人都没有认识到某些结论的真像，当我开始学习法拉第的研究时我已经明白了，这些事实被不鼓励质疑鼓励死记硬背的教学过程不公正的影响了。

As you read the following list of experimental facts concerning Faraday's generator, you will retrace the steps of my initial readings during March 1965. With open eyes and an open mind, question for yourself what would happen under the conditions described below.*

当你读下面的关于法拉第的发电机实验事实时，你将追溯我在1965年的步伐。打开双眼打开思想，问你自己在下面描述的情况下会发生什么。
