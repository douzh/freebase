# 能量的错误观念 

Misconception of Energy 

3. Failure to recognize that this universal body of moving matter has been created by some power outside of itself has led science to conclude that the energy which created matter is within itself. Even more erroneous is the conclusion that energy is a condition of matter, such as heat. 

3.错误的认识，运动的物体被物体外的某些能量创建，已经导致创建物体的能量在物体内部的错误结论。更荒谬的结论是能量是物质的状态，如热。 

This fallacy has led to the conclusion that Creation will disappear when energy “runs down.” The first and second laws of thermodynamics are built upon this obviously wrong conclusion. The universe will never “run down.” It is as eternal as God is eternal. 

这种谬论产生结论，当能量“热寂”后创造将消失。第一和第二热力学定律就创建在这个明显的错误结论上。宇宙永远不会“热寂”，它如同上帝一样永恒存在。 

This universe of matter-in-motion is a Mind-conceived, Mind-creating body. As such it is as much a product of Mind as a pair of shoes, a poem, a symphony, or a tunnel under a mountain is a product of the Mind which conceived it, and motivated the action which produced it as a formed body of matter. 

注：意思是意识产生世界。 

The poem is not the poet, however, nor is the symphony its composer. In a like sense this universe if not its own Creator. Whatever qualities or attributes there are in any product-whether it be an adding machine or a universe-have been extended to that product by their creator to manifest qualities, attributes and energies which are alone in the creator of that product. 

注：没明白什么意思 

Nor is the IDEA which matter manifests within matter. IDEA is never created. Idea is a Mind quality. Idea never leaves the omniscient（无所不知的） Light of Mind. Idea is but simulated by matter-in-motion. 

注：没明白什么意思 

IDEA never leaves its invisible state to become visible matter. Bodies which manifest IDEA are made in the image of their creator’s imaginings. 

IDEA从没有从不可见状态变为可见的物质。显示IDEA的物质是它们的创建者想像的图像。 

Every creation, whether of God or man, is an extension of its creator. It is projected from him by a force which is within its creator and not in the projected product. 

注：没明白什么意思 

All of the knowledge, energy and method of creating any product are properties of Mind alone. There is no knowledge, energy, life, truth, intelligence, substance or thought in the motion which matter is.
