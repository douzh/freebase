# 新宇宙观 

A NEW CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSE 

新宇宙观 

Once in a while, in long century periods, some vast new knowledge comes to the slowly unfolding race of man through cosmically-inspired geniuses, or men of supervision, who have an awareness of the reality which lies beyond this universe of illusion. 

 

This new knowledge if of such a revolutionary nature in its time of coming that whole systems of thought, even unto entire cosmogonies, are rendered obsolete. 

这种新知识在它的年代对整个思想系统以至于整个宇宙论太有革命性， 所以被放弃。 

When each cosmic messenger gives such new inspired knowledge to the world, the whole human race rises one step higher on that long ladder of unfolding which reaches from the jungle of man’s beginnings unto the high heavens of ultimate complete Cosmic Consciousness and awareness of unity with God. 

当每个宇宙信使给予世界这种创新知识时，整个人类种族将在进化的长梯上走上一个台阶，？？？ 

Thus it is that man has ever been transformed by the “renewing of his mind” with new knowledge given to him since hiss early beginnings, through the Mahabharata and Bhagavad-Gita of the early Brahmic days, through such ancient mystics as Laotze, Confucius, Zoroaster, Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Epicteus, Euclid, Mohammed, Moses, Isaiah, and Jesus, whose cosmic knowledge utterly transformed the practice of human relations of their day. 

？？？ 

Then dawned a new day of the gathering of so-called “empirical knowledge,” which is gained through the senses by research and observation of effects of matter-in-motion rather than through the Consciousness of inspired Mind in meditation, which is the way that mystics and geniuses acquire their knowledge. 

之后所谓的“经验主义”新的开端，通过感觉获取知识，通过研究观察运动的物体的效果，而不是通过激起冥想心力意识，那正是神秘主义者和天才获取知识的方式。 

Since the days of Galileo this undependable method of gaining knowledge through the senses has served to multiply man’s reasoning powers by teaching him HOW to do marvelous things with electricity and the elements of matter, bug not one great savent of science can tell the WHY-or the CAUSE—of his familiar effects. 

从伽利略开始这种不可靠的获取知识的方法，通过感觉获取知识，已经广泛用于人类的推理，通过教授如何用电和物质元素引起非凡的事情，但没有一个伟大的科学家能说出为什么会产生相同的效果。 

If asked what electricity, light, magnetism, matter or energy is ,he frankly answers:” I do not know.” 

如果被问到什么是电、光、磁、物质或能量，它直率的回答：“我不知道”。 

If science actually does not know the WHY – or WHAT – or CAUSE –of these essentials, it necessarily follows that it is, admittedly, without knowledge. 

如果科学实际上不知道为什么或什么引起这些的本质，由此而得，公认的，它不是知识。 

It is merely informed – but information gathered through the senses is not knowledge. The senses sense only EFFECTS. Knowledge is confined to the CAUSE of EFFECTS. 

它仅仅是知道 – 但信息是通过感觉来收集的。这些感觉只是一些效果。知识是应该是产生这些效果的原理。 

The sense are limited to but a small range of perception of the EFFECTS which they sense, and even that small range is saturated with the deceptions and distortions created by the illusion of motion. 

感觉被限制在效果一个小范围内，即使在这个小范围内由于运动的错觉也充满了欺骗和扭曲。 

It is impossible for the senses to penetrate any EFFECT to ascertain its CAUSE for the cause of illusion is not within effect. For this reason the entire mass of co-called empirical knowledge which science has gained by reasoning through the senses if invalid. 

通过感觉看透效果来弄清效果产生的起因是不可能的。因为如此整个所谓的经验知识，科学已经通过感觉获取，是不成立的。 

Let us examine some of these conclusions which form the basis of scientific theory and see why all present theory is invalid, and why its entire structure has no resemblance to either Nature’s laws or its processes. I will now enumerate some of these unnatural theories. 

让我们检验一些基础科学的结论，看看为什么当前的理论是无效的，为什么整个结构和自然定律或过程不相似或。我将列举一些违背自然的理论。
