# 科学的基础错误观念 

BASIC MISCONCEPTIONS OF SCIENCE 

1.The cardinal error of science lies in shutting the Creator out of His Creation. 

科学基本的错误在于关闭了它的创造性。 

This one basic error topples the whole structure, for out of it all of the other misconception of light, matter, energy, electricity, magnetism and atomic structure have grown. 

这个基础的错误倾倒了整个结构，产生了其它所有错误的观念，光、物质、能量、电、磁和原子结构。 

If science knew what LIGHT actually IS, instead of the waves and corpuscles of incandescent suns which science now thinks it is, a new civilization would arise from that one fact alone. 

如果学知道光实际是什么，而不是现在科学认为的波和高亮小粒子，一个新的文明将产生于一个唯一的事实。 

Light is not waves which travel at 186,000 miles per second, which science says it is, -- nor does light travel at all. 

光不是波，如科学所说一秒运行186,000公理，光是完全不运动的。 

The light of incandescent suns if but an effect of one of the two equally – opposed electric pressure conditions which interweave this universe into visible solids and liquids surrounded by invisible gases of space. 

太阳的光只是两个相等相反的电压环境，它使宇宙交织成可见的被不可见的空间气体环绕的固体和液体。 

These two opposite electric conditions which form the basis of the constitution of matter are the compressed condition of gravity pressure and expanded condition of radiation pressure. These two electric conditions are the equal – and – opposite pressures which make motion imperative and without which motion is impossible. 

这两相反的电环境，形成了物质结构的基础，是重力压力环境和辐射压力环境。这两种电环境是相等并相反的压力，压力使运动永在，没有压力运动是不可能产生的。 

The positive electric condition compresses large volumes of light-waves into small volumes by winding them up centripetally into spiral vortices by thrusting inward from without. That is what gravitation is. 

正电压力压缩光波的大体积到很小的体积，通过向心缠绕它们形成螺旋漩涡并在外部向里挤。这就是重力。 

The negative electric condition expands small volumes of light-waves into large volumes by unwinding them centrifugally into voiding equators where matter disappears. That is what radiation is. Radiation thrusts outwardly from within to depolarize matter and void motion. 

负电环境展开小体积的光波到大体积，通过离心解展开成大圆，物质消失。这就是辐射。辐射从里面向外猛推来消除物质和运动。 

The light of suns and the dark of spaces are but two opposite conditions of the same thing. They interchange constantly. Each becomes the other sequentially. 

太阳的光和空间的黑影只是相同东西的相反的两种环境。它们永恒的交替发生，相互转化。 

Science excluded God from its consideration because of the supposition that God could not be proven to exist by laboratory methods. 

科学把上帝排斥在外，因为不能通过科学方法证明其存在。 

This decision is unfortunate for God IS provable by laboratory methods. The locatable motionless Light which man mistakenly calls magnetism is the invisible, but familiar, Light which God IS – and with it He controls His universe – as we shall see. 

上帝被实验方法证明是不幸的。静止的光，人们错误的称为磁性是不可见的，但相似的，光就是上帝 – 上帝用光控制宇宙 – 如我们看到的。
