# 关于电磁的错误观念 

Misconception of Electro-Magnetism 

2.The Einstein theory of the constitution of matter conceives this universe to be “one great ocean of electro-magnetism, out of which – and into which – flow the streams of gravitation, matter and energy.” 

爱因斯坦的物质结构理论设想宇宙是一个“电磁的海洋，重力、物质和能量流从中流入流出”。 

Radiation, the equal-and-opposite mate of gravitation, without which gravitation is impossible, is entirely ignored in this fantastic and unnatural concept. 

辐射，这个和引力相等相反的力，没有它引力是不能存在的，在这个空想变态观念中被完全忽略了。 

Equally fantastic is the claim of this theory that “it is possible to have gravitation without matter,” and “for space to exist without gravity or without matter.” 

同样奇怪的是这个理论声称“没有物质是可能有引力存在的,”“存在没有引力和物质的空间。” 

The weak point in this theory is the fact that electro-magnetism if not an existent force in Nature; nor are there electro-magnetic fields or magnetic fields. Wave fields are electric – exclusively electric. 

这个无力的观点指明自然界中电磁不是一种存在的力；或不存在电磁场或磁场。Wave fields are electric – exclusively electric. 

Electricity is the only force which God makes use of create this universe. And the only two “tools” God makes use of for creating His universe of matter and motion are two pairs of opposed spiral vortices. One of these opposite pairs meets at apices at wave amplitudes to create spheres of matter and the other opposed pair meets at cone bases upon wave axes to void both matter and motion. ( See Figures 129 and 130,page 162) 

电是上帝创造这个宇宙用的唯一的力。上帝创造物质宇宙和运动的两个工具是用一对相反的螺旋旋涡。相反的螺旋旋涡中的一个在锥项处接触创建了物质圆球，另一个在锥底处接触消除物质和运动。（看图129和130）

These two pairs of opposed electric spiral vortices are the basic units which construct all matter. Together they form the electric waves of motion which create the various pressure conditions which are needed to produce the many seemingly different elements of visible and invisible matter. 

这两种相反的电力螺旋旋涡是所有物质的基础单元。它们形成运动的电波，运动的电波创建了变化的压力环境，这是产生可见和不可见的元素所需要的。 

Electricity is divided into two equal-and-opposite forces which thrust away from each other to build this polarized universe. 

电被分为两种相等并相反的力，它们相互排斥创建这个极化的宇宙。 

When inability to thrust away from each other takes its sequential turn in the pulse of the universal heartbeat, depolarization voids all opposition. Thus this universe consists of cycles of life followed by death – growth followed by decay, and generation followed by radiation – each expressed simultaneously and repeated sequentially forever without end. 

当远到不能再相互排斥， 

注：会形成一个循环，周而复始。 

That which science calls magnetism, and believes to be a force which has the power of lifting tons of steel, is God’s still Light which balances and controls the equality of electric division, but electricity alone performs all of the work of this universe. The magnetic Light which controls the universal balance performs no work whatsoever. 

科学所谓的磁，被认为是一种力可以提起数吨重的钢铁，是仍然是上帝之光，它平衡并控制两种电的平衡，电独自完成了宇宙所有工作。控制宇宙平衡的磁光永远也没做功。 

A bar magnet picks up nails because of the electric current which divided that steel into its activated polarized conditions, and not because of its focal poles of stillness which center its two activities. Even though the electric current has been withdrawn, the steel retains its electric activity for long periods and acts as though the current still remained. 

一个磁条吸起一些钉子，因为电流极化钢到活性的极化状态，不是因为静止的极点。因此电流离开后，钢依然保持很长时间的电活动，好似电流依然存在。 

Magnetic Light control might be likened to the rudder of a ship which controls the direction of the ship’s motion without in any way motivating that motion. 

磁光的作用好比船的船舵，控制船的运动方向，并不产生前进力。 

It might again be likened to the fulcrum which extends its power of expression through motion to a lever, without in any way acting to motivate that expressed motion of the lever. 

也可以比作杠杆的支点，扩大了杠杆的效果，但没有对杠杆的运动产生作用。 

God’s still magnetic Light is the fulcrum of this creating universe. Electricity is the two-way lever which extends from that fulcrum to give the universe its pulsing heartbeat of simulated life-death sequences. 

上帝的磁光是创建宇宙的支点。电是杠杆的两端，从支点伸展出来给宇宙脉动心跳，模仿生死时序。 

Wherever God’s Light appears in matter, there stillness centers motion, but there is no motion at that point. The center of gravity in a spherical sun or earth is one locatable point where God’s Light is. Likewise, the two still centers of north and south spiral vortices are other locatable balancing points of control. Likewise, the shaft which connects all pairs of opposed poles is an extension of stillness from the zero of wave beginnings to the zero of wave amplitudes, and the return of motion to the zero of its beginning in the stillness of its borning place on its wave axis. 

上帝之光出现在任何物质里，那是静止没有运动的。球形的太阳或地球的重心是一个上帝之光的所在点。同样的，南北两个静止的螺旋旋涡的中心是其它控制平衡点。同样的，连接相反极的轴是… 

This is a universe of Light-at-rest from which two opposed lights-of-motion appear to manifest the IDEA which is eternally sealed in the Light-at-rest.
