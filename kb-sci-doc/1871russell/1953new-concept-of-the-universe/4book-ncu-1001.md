# 致科学界的公开信 

An Open letter To The World of Science 

Gentlemen: 

This Open Letter to the World of Science, accompanied by a Treatise on The Russel Cosmogony, is being sent to approximately 350 members of our National Academy of Science and Royal Society of London, 100 Universities, and 300 leading newspapers. 

先生们：这封致世界科学界的公开信，连同《罗素宇宙论》的论著，已经被寄送给约350名国家科学院和伦敦皇家学会的成员，100所大学以及300家主要报纸。 

This announcement with its new concept of Light, Matter, Energy, Electricity and Magnetism is a simple yet complete, consistent and workable cosmogony which will enable future scientists to visualize the universe as ONE WHOLE, and will open the door to the New Age of Transmutation. 

这个以光、物质、能量、电和磁性为基础的新概念的公告，是一种简单而完整、一致且可行的宇宙论，将使未来的科学家能够将宇宙视为一个整体，并为转化的新时代开启大门。 

Recalling the important contributions I have already made to science, such as my work in completing the hydrogen octave and my prior discovery of the existence of the two atom bomb elements given to the scientific world in my two Periodic Tables of the Elements, assures me that you will give serious thought and attention to these documents. 

回想起我已经对科学做出的重要贡献，比如我在完成氢八度和我先前发现了两种原子弹元素的工作，这些都反映在我编写的两张元素周期表中，我相信这些文件将引起您的深思和关注。 

Present threatening world conditions make it imperative that science discloses the way whereby the weakest of nations can protect itself from the strongest of them and render attack by land, sea and air impotent. 

当前的威胁世界局势使科学必须揭示最弱小的国家如何保护自己免受最强大的国家的攻击，并使其在陆地、海上和空中的攻击变得无效。 

This new knowledge will give science this power. 

这种新知识将给科学这种力量。 

England could have been rendered immune from her devastating bombardment had the world been receptive to these new scientific discoveries which I endeavored to give to it when World War II started. Science, however, did make use of the two atom bomb elements mentioned above, which I charted and copyrighted in 1926. 

如果当时的世界对我在二战开始时努力传播的这些新的科学发现持开放态度，英国本可以免受惨痛轰炸之苦。然而，科学界却使用了我在1926年编制和版权登记的两种原子弹元素。 

The world needs new metals. Many new rustless metals of greater density, malleability and conductivity await division in vast quantities from carbon and silicon. These will be found when science discards its concept of matter as being substance, and becomes aware of the gyroscopic control of motion which will split the carbon tone into isotopes as a musical tone is split into sharps and flats. 

界需要新金属。许多新的不易生锈、密度更大、可塑性更强、导电性更好的金属等待从碳和硅中大量分离出来。而这些将会在科学界丢弃现有物质是实体的概念，并意识到旋转控制运动的地位之后被发现，就像将音乐音调分割成升降调之一样，这种运动将分裂碳音为同位素。 

In the chemical elements, the sharps and flats are isotopes. These can be produced by man in greater numbers than Nature has produced them, for Nature dose not begin to split her tones until she has passed two octaves beyond carbon. There is a tremendous opportunity for the netallurgist of tomorrow to create new metals in the carbon and silicon octaves. 

在化学元素中，升降调就是同位素。这些同位素可以由人制造比自然界产生的更多，因为自然界只有在超过碳两个八度之后才开始分割她的音调。未来的冶金师有一个巨大的机会，在碳和硅的八度中创造出新的金属。 

Of even greater importance to the world in this crucial period is the production of unlimited quantities of free hydrogen. This ideal weightless fuel could be transmuted from the atmosphere while in transit without the necessity of storage capacity. 

在这个关键性的时期，对世界更重要的是产生无限的游离氢。这种标准无重量燃料能从大气传输，传送中不需要存储。 

These are the important things which might new be known if Keller’s discovery had divulged the facts of geometric symmetry and dual curvature within the wave field. 

如果开普勒的发现揭露了波场中的几何双螺旋的事实，将有新的重要发现。 

His law of elliptical orbits evidences that he was on the verge of discovering that four – not two - magnetic poles control the dual opposed balance of this two-way universe. With but two magnetic poles a three-dimensional radial universe of time intervals and sequence would be impossible. A balanced universe must have two poles to control centripetal, generoactive force, and two compensating poles to control centrifugal, radioactive force. 

他的椭圆轨道定律说明它在发现的边缘，四个而不是两个磁极控制双向宇宙的双向相反的平衡。但只有两个磁极一个三维辐射宇宙of时间间隔和序列是重要的。一个平衡的宇宙必须有两个磁极控制向心的generoactive的力，两个互补的磁极控制离心的辐射的力。 

By means of such knowledge, science could rid the earth of fear of attack by any nation no matter how the attack might come, whether by land, sea or air. 

用这些知识和科学能摆脱来自地球其它国家攻击的恐惧，不论攻击来自哪里，陆地、海洋或空中。 

This new knowledge will give to science the cause of all the effects which have for centuries of research deceived the senses of scientific observers. 

新的知识将给出所有误导科学观察者几个世纪的效果的原因。 

Man has a Mind as well as having senses, but he has given preference to the evidence of his senses in the building of his cosmogony. Man can reason with his senses but he cannot know with then. Reasoning is sense-thinking not Mind-knowing. He has also produced effects without knowing their cause. 

人有思想也有感觉，但人更喜欢用感觉来建立宇宙产生论。人可以用感觉找出原因，但不能知道之后如何。原因是。。。？？？ 

The senses have not revealed to man that this is a substanceless universe of motion only. Neither have they told him the principle of polarity which divides the universal equilibrium into pairs of oppositely-conditioned mates to create a sex-divided electric two-way universe. 

？？ 

The time has come in the history of man when knowledge alone can save the human race. Man has for too long left the Creator out of His Creation, thinking He cannot be proven in the laboratory. 

时机已经来临，统一的理论可以拯救人类。人类已经太长时间放下创造的能力，这些不能在实验室证明。 

God not only can be proven in the laboratory, but because of the facts of that proof man can solve many heretofore hidden mysteries of the universe- such as that of the seed and growth – left and death cycles – the purpose of the inert gases as electric recorders of all repetitive effects – and the true process of atomic structure. 

上帝不仅可以在实验室证明，也可以由事实证明，人类可以解决许多以前宇宙隐藏的秘密，如生死轮回的起源，？？？，原子结构真实的运行过程。 

You might reasonably ask why I have withheld this knowledge for so many years. I have not withheld it. I tried in vain to give it from 1926 when I first published charts of the complete periodic tables herewith attached, up to the beginning of World War II when I tried to organize a laboratory group to save England from its unnecessary bombardment. 

I also accepted and held the Presidency of The Society of Arts and Sciences in New York For seven years for the sole purpose of giving to the world this new cosmogony based upon a two-way continuous, balanced universe to replace the one-way discontinuous, unbalanced universe which is presumably expanding to heat death. 

During this period, I lectured upon the misconceived idea that hydrogen is the basic number one atom of the periodic table, I explained that there are twenty-one other elements which precede it and that hydrogen itself is not a single element but a whole complex octave. I also explained the impossibility of there being any element without an inert gas as its source. At that time I distributed my periodic charts to approximately 800 scientists and universities. 

Further than inciting research which yielded so-called isotopes of hydrogen and heavy water, nothing came of my effort, nor did I receive the credit due me. Incidentally, those so-called isotopes are not isotopes but full-toned elements of an orderly octave group series. Isotopes do not occur in Nature until they reach the octave following the silicon octave. The reasons for this are fully explained in our Study Course. 

I wrote two books, gave many lectures and set up a demonstration laboratory in a university to prove that the elements are not different substances but are differently-conditioned pressures of motion – and that the structure of the atom is based upon the gyroscopic principle. 

As one after another of my discoveries appeared under other names, I acted on the advice of a friendly science editor to withhold any more of my new cosmogony until it was fully completed in words and diagrams, and again copyrighted. 

It has taken many years to so complete it that it is invulnerable to attack, but this has now been done, and this present treatise if as complete in brief as the whole cosmogony is complete in detail. 

I do not look for immediate acceptance of this revolutionary new knowledge. I do hope and expect, however, that the seed of it will grow within the comsciousness of science, and as I am nearing 82 years of age I feel it incumbent to announce the fact to science through this open letter and treatise that The Russell Cosmogony, which my gifted wife, Lao, and Ihave together written into a year’s Study Course of 935 uncontradictalbe pages, and 182 diagrams, is now complete. 

This course is now being studied all over the world and, through our students as seed, this new knowledge will ultimately transform the world. 

It is with the deep desire that a higher civilization shall arise that I send forth this message to mankind. The day is here when Science and Religion must marry, or through ignorance of God’s Universal Laws man will perish from the earth. 

Hoping that the world of science will recognize that this treatise has within it the answer to basic cause for which it has been so long and tirelessly searching, I am 

Sincerely yours,
