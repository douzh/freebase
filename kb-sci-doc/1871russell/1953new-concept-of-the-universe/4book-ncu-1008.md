Misconception of Matter 

4.Electric matter is but a mirror which reflects qualities outside itself to simulate those qualities within itself. 

In the Mind of any creator of any product is the IDEA of the formed body which Mind desires to produce. Also the knowledge, energy and method of production are in the Mind of the creator of that product and not in the product. The architect dose not say that the energy, idea, or construction methods are in the temple of his conceiving, nor should man say that they are in the temple of God’s conceiving. 

To thus claim that energy is a property of matter is to deprive The Creator of His omnipotence and omniscience. The entire universe manifests power, but the universe is not the power which it manifests. 

Not one particle of matter which constitutes the material body of any product can move of itself. It can move only through desire and command of the Mind of its creator extended to it electrically. 

The powers of “attraction” and “repulsion” which science mistakenly attributes to matter are electrical effects performing their one and only function of dividing an equilibrium into two opposing conditions, which extend equally form a dividing equator. The magnetic Light controls the balance of these two opposing conditions which interchange two ways in their endeavor tho void their opposing conditions, but the stresses and strains which seem to make matter attract and repel matter are electric effects. 

Electric effects of motion can be insulated from each other—but the magnetic Light of The Creator, which causes those effects, cannot be insulated from matter by matter. 

All matter is electric. Electricity conditions all matter under the measured control of the ONE MAGNETIC LIGHT which forever balance the TWO electrically-divided, conditioned lights of matter an space. 

Divided matter strains to find balance in the zero of equilibrium from which it was divided. The senses of man are mightily deceived by the illusions of appearance which cause him to conclude otherwise. 

Newton’s apple was not attracted to ground by gravitation. The high potential condition of that solid apple sought a similar high potential condition. That is to say it “fell” toward the earth to fulfill Nature’s law of like seeking like. 

Had Newton sat with the apple for a week or two he would have seem that same apple “rise” unto the heavens as a low potential gas seeking a like low potential position to balance its electrically-divided state. The “rising” of the decaying, expanding apple again fulfills Nature’s law of like seeking like. 

All polarizing bodies add to their densities and potentials. The apple which fell to the ground was a polarized body. All polarized bodies must reverse their polarities and depolarize. They then lose their densities and potentials. The depolarized apple returned to zero of its beginning. 

The Newtonian law is in this respect invalid because it accounts for but one half of the apple’s growth-decay cycle. This is a two-way universe of opposed effects of motion—not a oneway universe.
