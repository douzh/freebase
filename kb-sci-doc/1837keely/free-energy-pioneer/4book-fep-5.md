# 消失：基利之谜的最后阶段

Into the Void The Final Stage of the Keely Mystery

"Not long since, Canon Wilberforce asked Keely what would become of his discovery and his inventions in case of his death before they became of commercial value to the public. Keely replied that he had written thousands of pages, which he hoped would, in such an event, be mastered by some mind capable of pursuing his researches to practical ends. " 

Clara Bloomfield-Moore, Keely's Discoveries, Aerial Navigation, 1893

“不久之后，Canon Wilberforce问Keely，如果他的发现和发明在对公众具有商业价值之前死亡，它们会变成什么样子。Keely回答说，他已经写了数千页，他希望在这种情况下，能够将研究推向实际目的的人能够掌握这些内容。”

The final mystery in the Keely story that gave rise to much speculation in the years to come, was the disappearance of his papers, drawings and devices after he died.

In his lifetime, Bloomfield-Moore also wrote about manuscripts in which his philosophy was explained.1On one occasion, Keely told a reporter that he had "two books on hand...one of which was to come out within a year, possibly sooner," and the reporter was then shown some "proof sheets prepared by a friend from Keely's manuscript books." During the interview Keely confided to the reporter that, "I am at work at present on two books; the one which will announce my force to the scientific world will contain from 1,500 to 2,000 pages with 50 or 60 charts, describing the whole thing symbolically. It will appear in 1891."

在接下来的几年里，基利故事中的最后一个谜团引起了人们的猜测，那就是他去世后，他的文件、图纸和设备消失了。

布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔（Bloomfield Moore）一生中也写过解释其哲学的手稿。有一次，基利告诉记者，他“手头有两本书……其中一本将在一年内出版，可能会更早”，然后记者看到了一些“朋友从基利的手稿中准备的校样”。在采访中，基利向记者透露，“我目前正在写两本书；这本书将向科学界宣布我的力量，共1500至2000页，有50或60张图表，象征性地描述了整个过程。它将于1891年出版。”

Notwithstanding Keely's statement, 1891 did not witness his book in print. Nor would another projected book be printed later. Collier, always ready to come forward with one or another boisterous claim, obtained from Keely "elaborate descriptions of his various machines and devices, and much time was spent in Preparing drawings and specifications," another hint that drawings of Keely's devices did exist. Collier also had "in preparation a book entitled Two Decades with Keely, that would 'prove intensely interested reading.'" What its contents were we will probably never learn, since as far as is known, Collier's book too was never printed.

Even this facet of the Keely mystery is shrouded in uncertainty; we do not know if and exactly how many manuscripts or papers Keely wrote in his productive life.

尽管基利发表了声明，但1891年并没有见证他的书的印刷，以后也不会再印刷另一本预计的书。科利尔总是准备提出这样或那样的激烈主张，他从基利那里获得了“对他各种机器和设备的详细描述，并花了很多时间准备图纸和规范”，这是基利设备图纸确实存在的另一个暗示。科利尔还“准备了一本名为《与基利的二十年》的书，这本书将‘证明对阅读非常感兴趣’。”它的内容我们可能永远不会知道，因为据所知，科利尔的书也从未出版过。

即使是基利之谜的这一方面也笼罩在不确定性之中；我们不知道基利在他富有成效的生活中是否写了多少手稿或论文，也不知道到底写了多少。

In her book, Bloomfield-Moore quotes extensively from what she terms "Keely's writings," unfortunately without identifying this source. From a statement by the attorney of Keely's widow, this source of written material may perhaps be identified: "A week or so after his death access to his papers was secured for the first time. Bundle after bundle was unrolled and minutely examined, but no secret appeared. Fragmentary MSS, in the shape of a diary, unfinished letters, proof sheets of matter ultimately appearing in Mrs. Bloom-field-Moore's book Keely and His Discoveries, were found in abundance, but no revelation." And some months afterward, during a second investigation of his workshop, an unfinished letter from Keely to BloomfieldMoore was found. The whereabouts of these documents are not known.

布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔在她的书中大量引用了她所说的“基利的著作”，但不幸的是，她没有指明这一来源。从Keely遗孀的律师的一份声明中，也许可以确定这一书面材料的来源：“在他去世一周左右后，第一次确保了对他的文件的访问。一捆捆又一捆地展开，仔细检查，但没有发现任何秘密。日记、未完成的信件、最终出现在Mrs。布鲁姆·菲尔德·摩尔的书《基利和他的发现》被大量发现，但没有任何启示。几个月后，在对他的工作室进行第二次调查时，基利给布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔的一封未完成的信被发现了。这些文件的下落不明。

According to Bloomfield-Moore, Keely also wrote "three treatises to explain his system" and she lists the titles of these papers: "Theoretical Expose or Philosophical Analysis of Vibro-Molecular, Vibro-Atomic, and Sympathetic Vibro-Etheric Forces, as Applied to Induce Mechanical Rotation by Negative Sympathetic Attraction." The second treatise is titled, equally verbose "Explanatory Analysis of Vibro-Acoustic Mechanism in all its Different Groupings or Combinations to Induce Propulsion and Attraction (Sympathetically) by the Power of Sound-Force; as also the Different Conditions of Intensity, both Positive and Negative, on the Progressive Octaves to Ozonic Liberation and Luminosity."

根据Bloomfield Moore的说法，Keely还写了“三篇论文来解释他的系统”，她列出了这些论文的标题：“应用负交感吸引力诱导机械旋转的振动分子、振动原子和交感振动以太力的理论揭示或哲学分析。”第二篇论文的标题同样冗长，“解释性分析所有不同组或组合中的振动声学机制，以通过声力的力量诱导推进和吸引（交感）；以及强度的不同条件，包括正和负，对臭氧释放和发光的进程八度。”

The final paper has the equally long title, "The Determining Principle of Matter, or the Connective Link Between the Finite and the Infinite, Progressively Considered from the Crude Molecular to the Compound Inter-Etheric; showing the Control of Spirit over Matter in all the Variations of Mass Chords and Molecular Groupings, both Physical and Mechanical."

最后一篇论文的标题同样长，“物质的决定原理，或有限和无限之间的联系，从粗分子到复合以太；显示了在物理和机械的质量弦和分子群的所有变化中精神对物质的控制。”

Unfortunately she does not elaborate any further on these treatises and nowhere in her book do we find a description of these writings, such as the number of pages, their contents or the locations. It is doubtful that she read or even saw these papers at all. It may be that Keely wrote to her about the papers in one of his letters, and that she took his word for the existence of these treatises. Most probably the papers were never published and remained private. Contemporary newspapers, which usually devoted much space to various details of his life and his inventions never mentioned their publication.

不幸的是，她没有进一步阐述这些论文，在她的书中，我们也没有找到对这些著作的描述，比如页数、内容或位置。她是否读过甚至看到过这些文件，这是令人怀疑的。可能是基利在他的一封信中给她写了关于这些论文的信，她相信这些论文的存在。最有可能的是，这些论文从未发表过，而且一直是私人的。当代报纸通常会花很多篇幅报道他的生活和发明的各种细节，但从未提及其出版。

There is also the hint in The Snell Manuscript, a document that was originally written around 1934 and kept in private hands until it was recently published. Its author, C.W. Snell of Detroit, Michigan, writes that, "The secret of Keely's instruments died with him. These notes were made from books written by Keely himself, found in an old library. The books have since disappeared...." This intriguing allegation is unfortunately ill-fitted for closer examination, since the name of the library is not mentioned and no bibliographical details of these books or papers, allegedly written by Keely himself, are given.

《斯内尔手稿》中也有这一暗示，这是一份最初写于1934年左右的文件，在最近出版之前一直由私人保管。该书的作者、密歇根州底特律市的C.W.Snell写道，“Keely仪器的秘密与他一起消失了。这些笔记是由Keely自己写的书制成的，这些书是在一个旧图书馆里发现的。这些书后来就不见了……”不幸的是，这一有趣的指控不适合更仔细地研究，因为图书馆的名字没有被提及，也没有提供这些据称是基利本人所写的书籍或论文的目录细节。

Some parts of Keely's philosophies did appear in print, however. There are, for instance, the portions in Colville's Dashed Against the Rock, published in 1894. And recently the title page of what appears to be a book, written by Keely, was published, called Keely's Acoustic Theoretical Charts with a long subtitle, rivaling those as mentioned by Bloomfield-Moore. The book was printed in Philadelphia in 1887 and consists of a series of remarkable drawings as far as can be determined, since it is by no means certain that the charts were the sole contents of the book. Unfortunately this book is not included in the collections of the two most extensive libraries in the Western world, and thereby cannot be studied. A routine search that I conducted in the Library of Congress showed that only four titles about Keely, and not written by him, are in the possession of the American libraries today. A consultation of the British libraries delivered only a handful of pamphlets written by Bloomfield-Moore.

然而，基利哲学的某些部分确实出现在了印刷品中。例如，科尔维尔1894年出版的《撞向岩石》中就有这些部分。最近，Keely写的一本名为《Keely的声学理论图表》的书的标题页出版了，副标题很长，与Bloomfield Moore提到的不相上下。这本书于1887年在费城印刷，由一系列引人注目的图画组成，因为无法确定图表是这本书的唯一内容。不幸的是，这本书没有被西方世界两个最广泛的图书馆收录，因此无法进行研究。我在美国国会图书馆进行的一次例行搜索显示，今天美国图书馆只有四本关于基利的书，而不是他写的。英国图书馆的一次咨询只提供了布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔写的几本小册子。

So, while we are by no means certain that the charts were the only contents of the book, this is at least an indication that Keely did in fact trust some of his philosophy to paper and took the effort of publishing it. Bloomfield-Moore never refers to this 1887 book or any other work in her writings, and the contemporary newspapers make no mention of this particular book whatsoever, and all in all this is suspicious. What the press did write about was a large manuscript written by Keely. There is the tale by a reporter who was shown "a large book filled with heavy cardboard plates, each of which was a treatise in itself, all drawn with a pen by Mr. Keely with beautiful exactness. Nearly every one of these plates had one or more bars of music, showing the dominant chords of vibrations which governed certain combinations." Probably these plates were the same as those which Keely published in 1887. It is claimed that he handed out handsomely framed reproductions of such a chart to various backers.

因此，尽管我们不能确定图表是这本书的唯一内容，但这至少表明Keely确实相信自己的一些哲学，并努力出版了这本书。Bloomfield Moore在她的著作中从未提及这本1887年的书或任何其他作品，当代报纸也没有提及这本书，所有这些都是可疑的。新闻界所写的是基利写的一份大手稿。有一位记者的故事，他看到“一本很大的书，里面装满了沉重的纸板板，每一本书本身就是一篇论文，都是基利先生用笔画的，非常精确。几乎每一个纸板板上都有一个或多个音乐条，显示了支配某些组合的主要振动和弦。”这些图版可能与Keely在1887年出版的图版相同。据称，他向各种支持者分发了这种图表的精美相框复制品。

It was also written that when Keely died, he left "a large number of drawings illustrating the principles of vibratory philosophy. Each plate had one or more charts of music, showing the dominating chords or vibrations which govern certain combinations," and sometimes a newspaper would print a number of these striking charts as a curiosity.

Two days after Keely's death, a newspaper wrote that Keely "left a great mass of manuscript relating to the progress of his experiments, which is the property of his estate, and can only be disposed of in the administration of his effects."

还有人写道，基利去世后，留下了“大量描绘振动哲学原理的图纸。每个图版都有一个或多个音乐图表，显示了支配某些组合的主导和弦或振动”，有时报纸会出于好奇打印出一些引人注目的图表。

基利去世两天后，一家报纸写道，基利“留下了大量与实验进展有关的手稿，这是他的财产，只能在管理他的效果时处理。”

More allusions to the existence of his papers kept cropping up in the days after his death. A newspaper stated that "we did find Keely's voluminous diary covering his experiments, his successes and failures, from hour to hour and day to day through long, torturing years, from 1872-73 up to the time of his last illness. It is a complete record and exceedingly interesting. In view of this daily detailed and minute history of his experiments with his motors there is every reason for believing that Keely was honest and told the truth about his inventions."

在他死后的几天里，越来越多关于他论文存在的典故不断出现。一家报纸说“我们确实发现了Keely的长篇日记，内容涵盖了他的实验、他的成功和失败，从1872-73年到他最后一次生病，在漫长而痛苦的岁月中，日复一日。这是一个完整的记录，非常有趣。鉴于他每天用电机进行实验的详细而微小的历史，我们完全有理由相信Keely是一个聪明的人。”并说出了他的发明的真相。"

At the time of Keely's death, there were other documents in existence as well, such as those that were kept in the corporate office of the Keely Motor Company in the attic of a brick building on Walnut Street above Ninth in Philadelphia. The place was tenanted by Schuellerman. "The office is uncarpeted and almost destitute of furniture. There are no shades on the windows, and the light that enters them throws its rays upon a strange variety of photographic blueprints, working drawings and queer mechanical designs which illustrate the early and later stages of Keely's researches in the mysteries of molecular and atomic forces," a reporter wrote. The whereabouts of these documents are not known.

基利去世时，还有其他文件，比如那些保存在费城第九街核桃街一栋砖砌建筑阁楼上的基利汽车公司公司办公室里的文件。这个地方被舒尔曼租了下来。一位记者写道：“办公室没有铺地毯，几乎没有家具。窗户上没有阴影，进入窗户的光线投射到各种奇怪的摄影蓝图、工作图纸和奇怪的机械设计上，这些都说明了基利研究分子和原子力奥秘的早期和后期阶段。”。这些文件的下落不明。

Three days after Keely's death, B.L. Ackermann, president of the Keely Motor Company, visited Anna Keely upon her request by telegram. He told a reporter that "On my arrival at Mrs. Keely's house...I found her so prostrated that she was unable to more than state that Mr. Keely had left in her possession a manuscript of 2,000 pages, which explains the whole system and the work he has done."

Keely去世三天后，Keely汽车公司总裁B.L.Ackermann应Anna Keely的电报要求拜访了她。他告诉一名记者，“当我到达基利夫人家时……我发现她非常虚弱，她只能说基利先生给她留下了一份2000页的手稿，其中解释了整个系统和他所做的工作。”

Two days later, a Philadelphia newspaper wrote that, "It is not at all impossible.. .that litigation may result over possession of Mr. Keely's papers and the machine, which he left uncompleted. Mrs. Keely is unable to be seen and has not in any way signified as yet her intentions with respect to the disposition of her husband's papers." Perhaps the Keely Motor Company had some dark misgivings, for the article continued that, "In case she should elect to refuse any members of the company access to the papers, and that she may adopt this course has already begun to be hinted at, the matter will be taken into court." Collier seized the opportunity to repeat that he was "in possession of much information on the subject of the motor," and that he was "confident that he knows enough about it to construct a machine similar to Mr. Keely's." Collier was in fact "now engaged in preparing for the press a work bearing on Keely's invention, which he expects, will occasion a great revival of scientific interest in Keely's work." The article ended with Collier's optimistic statement that neither he nor Thomas expected "any refusal on Mrs. Keely's part to hand over all her husband's papers and the contents of the laboratory."

两天后，费城的一家报纸写道，“这不是完全不可能的……诉讼可能会导致对Keely先生的文件和机器的占有，而Keely先生没有完成。Keely夫人无法露面，也没有以任何方式表明她对处理她丈夫的文件的意图。”也许Keely汽车公司有一些阴暗的疑虑，文章继续写道，“如果她选择拒绝公司任何成员查阅文件，并且她可能会采取这一做法，这一消息已经开始被暗示，此事将被送上法庭。”科利尔抓住机会重申，他“掌握了许多关于汽车主题的信息。”他“相信自己对它有足够的了解，可以制造出一台类似于Keely先生的机器。”事实上，科利尔“现在正在为媒体准备一项与基利的发明有关的工作，他预计这项工作将极大地激发科学界对基利工作的兴趣。”文章最后科利尔乐观地表示，他和托马斯都没有想到“基利夫人会拒绝交出她丈夫的所有论文和实验室的内容。”

On November 24, only two days after the first mention of Keely's manuscript in the press, and a day after his funeral, the first strange contradiction occurred. That day Mr. Schuellerman said that, "he did not know anything one way or the other about the alleged manuscript which it is said Mr. Keely left with his wife. That would be known after the conference with Mrs. Keely."

11月24日，就在基利的手稿首次被媒体提及两天后，也就是他葬礼的第二天，第一个奇怪的矛盾发生了。那天，舒勒曼先生说，“他对据称基利先生留给妻子的手稿一无所知。这将在与基利夫人会面后知道。”

It would become even stranger. President Ackermann, who mentioned two days earlier that he had heard from Keely's widow about me existence of the manuscript, now told an entirely different story when he was asked how he knew that Mr. Keely left in his wife's custody a manuscript describing his discoveries in detail: "...he said that Mr. Keely had told him he had written such a paper several times in the last twenty-five years. Mr. Ackermann said he had not read it but Mr. Keely had pulled out a drawer of his desk and pointed out papers as the manuscript, so he was sure it existed."

这将变得更加陌生。阿克曼总统两天前提到，他从基利的遗孀那里听说了这份手稿的存在。当被问及他是如何知道基利先生将一份详细描述他的发现的手稿交给妻子保管时，他讲述了一个完全不同的故事：“……他说，基利先生。基利告诉他，在过去的二十五年里，他写过好几次这样的论文。阿克曼先生说他没有读过，但基利先生从桌子上拿出一个抽屉，指出文件就是手稿，所以他确信它存在。"

Another newspaper meanwhile remarked on the same day that, "The future of the Keely motor depends on the manuscript of 2,000 pages which, it is said, the dead inventor left his widow."

On November 25, the word was out, and intrigue was to be expected: "A lively legal contest is expected between Mrs. John W. Keely, widow of the inventor...and the Keely Motor Company, over the possession of all papers left by the dead man bearing on the mysterious apparatus, the alleged secret of which he alone knew."

与此同时，另一家报纸在同一天评论道，“Keely发动机的未来取决于2000页的手稿，据说，这位已故的发明家留下了他的遗孀。”

11月25日，消息传出，人们期待着阴谋：“发明家的遗孀约翰·W·基利夫人……和基利汽车公司之间将展开一场激烈的法律竞赛，争夺死者留下的与神秘仪器有关的所有文件的所有权，而所谓的秘密只有他自己知道。”

Apparently his widow had foreseen all this, for she hired an attorney named John G. Johnson. She had "surprised" the directors of the Keely Motor Company on the day of the funeral. What the surprise was, we may never know, but the directors went straight to Collier. Collier, we learn, was no longer a member of the company, and had made a sudden turn of loyalty: "It is said that Dr. Thomas and Mr. Collier were both friendly to the interests of Mrs. Keely, and that should a legal fight come up they will be on her side... .There are other interests involved, and it is asserted that Mrs. Keely will resist any attempt by the company to deprive her of what she considers to be her lawful inheritance."

显然，他的遗孀预见到了这一切，因为她雇了一位名叫约翰·G·约翰逊的律师。葬礼当天，她让基利汽车公司的董事们“大吃一惊”。我们可能永远都不知道这是什么惊喜，但董事们直接去找了科利尔。我们了解到，科利尔不再是该公司的成员，并突然转变了忠诚：“据说托马斯博士和科利尔先生都对基利夫人的利益很友好，如果发生法律纠纷，他们将站在她一边……这还涉及其他利益，据称基利夫人将抵制公司剥夺她认为合法遗产的任何企图。”

A day later, Keely's grief-stricken widow refused to see anyone, and reporters were not able to communicate with the directors of the Keely Motor Company, therefore "no formal request has yet been preferred by those interested for permission to examine any papers Mr. Keely may have left."

By November 29, the situation had not changed, and "So far as known no will has been found, but certain manuscript is said to be in the possession of Mrs. Keely. She is said to have made a search of the inventor's workshop for valuable papers, but the result of this is not known. All the machinery, tools, etc. in the shop are the property of the company, Mr. Collier stated...The keys of the workshop are still held by Mrs. Keely."

一天后，基利悲痛欲绝的遗孀拒绝与任何人见面，记者也无法与基利汽车公司的董事沟通，因此“那些有兴趣的人还没有正式请求允许检查基利先生可能留下的任何文件。”

到11月29日，情况还没有改变，“到目前为止，还没有找到遗嘱，但据说某些手稿归基利夫人所有。据说她曾在发明人的工作室里寻找有价值的论文，但结果不得而知。”。科利尔表示。。。车间的钥匙仍由基利夫人保管。"

On the same day, Mr. Schuellerman also said that, "Until Mrs. Keely's position and intentions are known, and until something definite is known about the manuscript, which, it is said, Mr. Keely left, describing his secret and his discoveries in detail, no action.. .can be taken by the directors of the company. "

Indeed, the Keely Motor Company did not fare well under these setbacks. The monthly meeting on November 29 was canceled, and "neither the secretary nor Charles B. Collier...were able to state just when the meeting would take Place. Inquiry at Mrs. Keely's house at 17th and Oxford Sts. failed to elicit any information." In reply to a reporter, Johnson said that "complications have arisen, which make it impossible for him to represent Mrs. Keely." Those complications were not specified.

同一天，Schuellerman先生还表示，“在基利夫人的立场和意图被知晓之前，在对手稿有确切的了解之前，据说基利先生离开了手稿，详细描述了他的秘密和发现，公司董事……不能采取任何行动。”

事实上，基利汽车公司在这些挫折中表现不佳。11月29日的月度会议被取消，“秘书和查尔斯·B·科利尔……都无法说明会议何时举行。在基利夫人位于17街和牛津街的家中进行的调查未能获得任何信息。”约翰逊在回答记者时说，“出现了复杂情况，使他无法代表基利夫人。”这些并发症没有具体说明。

Doubts among those interested in Keely's legacy arose once more: "The late inventor Keely's mysterious secret is just as securely locked up today as when he was alive, and none of the directors of the motor company or the many stockholders know what Keely has left in the way of papers or models." And some days later Scientific American wondered, "whether the mass of the manuscript which he left will be of any value or not, remains to be seen."

那些对基利的遗产感兴趣的人再次产生了怀疑：“已故发明家基利的神秘秘密今天和他活着的时候一样被牢牢地锁住了，汽车公司的董事或许多股东都不知道基利在论文或模型方面留下了什么。”几天后，《科学美国人》想知道，“他留下的大量手稿是否有价值，还有待观察。”

On December 1, Keely's will did turn up; perhaps it was found during Mrs. Keely's search of his workshop. Keely's widow was made sole legatee and testatrix of an estate of \$10,000. The will made no mention whatsoever of his motor.

By December 5, the Board of Directors of the Keely Motor Company were in high hopes again. Much was expected from a conference to be held between Ackermann, Schuellerman who represented the company, and Charles S. Hill, attorney for Mrs. Keely.

12月1日，Keely的遗嘱出现了；也许是在基利夫人搜查他的工作室时发现的。Keely的遗孀成为10000美元遗产的唯一受遗赠人和立遗嘱人。遗嘱中没有提及他的汽车。

到12月5日，基利汽车公司董事会再次被寄予厚望。该公司的代表舒勒曼（Schuellermann）阿克曼（Ackermann）和基利夫人的律师查尔斯·S·希尔（Charles S.Hill）将举行一次会议，人们对此寄予厚望。

Nothing substantial was reached; Ackermann had his "short conference" with Hill. The discussion turned to the rights to the manuscript which Keely left, "and will be continued today." Ackermann did say that Mrs. Keely would "surrender the manuscript for an interest in the company."  On the same day, an anonymous stockholder confided to a reporter that according to him, "The talk about that manuscript is all nonsense. Keely made some copious notes for his own benefit, but how could he commit to paper that which he could not understand himself?"

没有达成实质性协议；阿克曼与希尔举行了“简短会议”。讨论转向了基利留下的手稿的权利，“今天将继续。”阿克曼确实说过，基利夫人将“为了公司的利益而交出手稿。” 同一天，一位匿名股东向记者透露，据他说，“关于那份手稿的谈论都是无稽之谈。基利为了自己的利益做了一些丰富的笔记，但他怎么能把自己看不懂的东西写在纸上呢？”

Precisely a week later, on December 14, the annual meeting of the Keely Motor Company was planned, but it was not expected that a quorum would be present to transact any business: "The by-laws of the company require that 50,000 shares of stock shall be represented at the meeting and it is not expected that this requirement will be met....Another reason for the postponement of the meeting is due to the fact that the representatives of the company have reached no conclusion with Mrs. Keely." It also appeared that Ackermann and the attorney of Keely's widow held several meetings, but were unable to "come to an understanding."

整整一周后的12月14日，基利汽车公司的年会计划召开，但预计不会有法定人数出席会议处理任何事务：“公司章程要求50000股股票应派代表出席会议，预计这一要求不会得到满足……会议推迟的另一个原因是，公司代表尚未与Keely女士达成一致。”阿克曼和基利遗孀的律师似乎也举行了几次会议，但未能“达成谅解”

The meeting was postponed due to the "small attendance." Of the 50,000 shares, only 3,500 were present. Ackermann was not present, but he drew up a five point letter that Schuellerman read. In it, Ackermann again changed his statements concerning Keely's manuscript. Now he alleged that Keely had informed him that the manuscripts were in the possession of Mrs. Keely.  Point five related to the Keely manuscript and projected a gloomy view of the future of the Keely Motor Company in case of an everlasting absence of his paper: "Knowing, or, at least presuming, that with such manuscripts in the possession of the company, in addition to the devices, machinery, and so forth, there would exist a very favorable chance in attaining the same results, and that without such, or the same papers in possession of unfriendly or hostile persons unknown to us, the condition under such hypothesis, appeared to me very problematical of ever getting at results, or if so at any time, only in the far future."

会议因“出席人数少”而推迟。在5万股股票中，只有3500股出席。阿克曼没有出席，但他起草了一封五点信，舒尔曼读了一遍。在信中，阿克曼再次改变了他对基利手稿的说法。现在他声称基利已经通知他手稿归基利夫人所有。第五点与Keely手稿有关，并对Keely汽车公司的未来提出了悲观的看法，以防他的论文永远缺席：“我知道，或者至少假设，如果公司拥有这些手稿，再加上设备、机器等，就有很好的机会获得同样的结果，如果没有这些手稿，或者我们不知道的不友好或敌对的人拥有同样的文件，在我看来，这种假设下的情况是非常有问题的永远不会有结果，或者如果在任何时候有，只在遥远的未来。"

And now, a month after Keely's death, the conclusion was reached, but it would not be in the most harmonious of circumstances. Amidst the fights, the scandal, the accusations, and the further dissolution of the Keely Motor Company, we also learn more about the fate of Keely's alleged 2,000 page manuscript.

现在，在基利去世一个月后，这个结论已经得出，但这并不是最和谐的情况。在争斗、丑闻、指控和基利汽车公司的进一步解散中，我们还了解了更多关于基利所谓的2000页手稿的命运。

On December 20, the last remnants of solidarity between members of the Keely Motor Company now completely crumbled, and a newspaper ironically mentioned that, "Round one of the Keely Motor Company stockholders fight ended at 2:00 by a sudden adjournment which just saved Charles Collier, Jr., from an impending knockout at the hands of B.L. Ackermann and C.L. Schuellerman." Ackermann accused Collier of pocketing large sums of money, "and the mere mention of money aroused the thirty stockholders present." Young Mr. Collier.. .shouted to Mr. Ackermann, "That's a lie! That's a lie!" Ackermann himself faced accusations of having secured large quantities of stock by unsigned letters.35 All in all, the Keely Motor Company was in a disgraceful state and its members a sorry lot - but the worst was yet to come.

12月20日，Keely Motor Company成员之间最后的团结已经彻底瓦解，一家报纸讽刺地提到，“Keely Motors Company股东之争的第一轮于2点结束，突然休会，小查尔斯·科利尔免于即将被B.L.Ackermann和C.L.Schuellerman淘汰。”阿克曼指责科利尔把大笔钱收入囊中，“一提到钱就引起了在场的三十名股东的注意。”年轻的科利尔先生。对阿克曼先生喊道：“这是个谎言！这是个骗局！”阿克曼本人也面临着通过未签名信件获得大量股票的指控。

A month had now passed since Ackermann alleged that he had heard of Keely's manuscript. At the meeting, Hill, Anna Keely's attorney, demonstrated that he had studied the financial proceedings of the company very well, and he said that the history of the relations between the late John W. Keely and the Keely Motor Company was a tangled web of unfulfilled promises, broken contracts, grievous misunderstandings and mutual recriminations.

阿克曼声称他听说了基利的手稿，一个月过去了。在会议上，Anna Keely的律师Hill证明，他对公司的财务程序研究得很好，他说，已故的John W.Keely和Keely汽车公司之间的关系历史是一个错综复杂的网络，包括未兑现的承诺、违约的合同、严重的误解和相互指责。

Hill pointed out that, "if any business operations are to be carried on, having the Keely discoveries as their basis, the present Keely Motor Company is not in an advantageous position to do so. A body of men attempting to exercise corporate powers where there is a question as to the validity of their existence as a corporation per se, would subject itself to unlimited litigation which otherwise might be avoided."

Hill could therefore easily enforce his position by stating: "If you force me to the point where I disclose certain things, I don't think the Keely Motor Company will ever do much more business."

希尔指出，“如果要以基利的发现为基础进行任何商业运营，目前的基利汽车公司在这样做方面并不有利。一个试图行使公司权力的团体，如果他们作为一个公司本身存在的有效性存在问题，就会受到无限的诉讼，否则可能会避免。"

因此，希尔可以很容易地表明自己的立场：“如果你强迫我披露某些事情，我认为基利汽车公司不会做更多的生意。”

So it seemed that the rumors about financial fraud that had always surrounded the Keely Motor Company were devastatingly true. But what about Keely's mysterious manuscript? Did it really exist? If so, where was it, and what happened to it?

Hill stated: "The reports concerning immense quantities of manuscript left behind him are so far as I am aware untrue." A little later Hill said, "...I do not think that Mr. Keely's secret is written down," which, of course, was a strange statement from someone who according to Ackermann had previously said that Keely's widow would turn in the manuscript in exchange for a substantial share in the Keely Motor Company. Hill also stated that "he had made a careful examination of the effects of Mr. Keely and that no detailed manuscript had been found."

因此，一直围绕着基利汽车公司的关于财务欺诈的传言似乎是毁灭性的真实。但基利的神秘手稿呢？它真的存在吗？如果是，它在哪里，发生了什么？

希尔表示：“据我所知，有关他留下大量手稿的报道是不真实的。”过了一会儿，希尔说：“……我不认为基利先生的秘密被写下来了。”当然，据阿克曼称，这是一个奇怪的说法，此人此前曾表示，基利的遗孀将交出手稿，以换取基利汽车公司的大量股份。希尔还表示，“他仔细检查了基利先生的影响，没有发现详细的手稿。”

According to Hill, "A few scraps of memoranda in the form of a diary, possibly 500 or 600 words, giving no clue to anything whatsoever, half completed drafts and letters written by him on business, and other such unimportant papers comprise the bulk of all that I have been able to find." Then Hill said ambiguously: "The whole thing is as uncertain a state as ever."

根据希尔的说法，“我所能找到的大部分都是日记形式的备忘录，可能有500或600字，没有任何线索，他写的半完成的草稿和信件，以及其他这样不重要的文件。”然后希尔含糊地说：“整件事和以往一样不确定。”

All this of course did not end the controversy surrounding the manuscript, which by now had attained an almost mythical status. Collier maintained a day after the meeting, that Keely "did prepare a manuscript pertaining to his experiments." Collier said that "some time previous to Keely's death he spoke to him regarding the preservation of the results of his work. Keely told him that he had manuscript, and showed it to Mr. Collier. Mr. Collier read part of it at the time."

当然，所有这些都没有结束围绕手稿的争议，手稿现在已经达到了近乎神话的地位。科利尔在会议结束后的第二天坚称，基利“确实准备了一份与他的实验有关的手稿。”科利尔说，“在基利去世前的一段时间，他与他就保存他的工作结果进行了交谈。基利告诉他，他有手稿，并将其展示给科利尔先生。科利尔先生当时阅读了其中的一部分。”

Later, Hill would claim that not only manuscripts had been found and that the bulk of these had been published in Bloomfield-Moore's book, but furthermore that, "Previous to his death Mr. Keely repeatedly asserted that all of his secret formulas by which his wonderful experiments were performed had been committed to writing so fully and completely that were he to be taken away the work could go on uninterruptedly. He had given tantalizing glimpses of great piles of MSS to some of the officials of the company. ...Such things as these naturally led me to hope for the existence of some valuable papers."

后来，希尔声称，不仅发现了手稿，而且大部分手稿都发表在布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔的书中，而且，“在他去世之前。基利一再断言，他进行精彩实验的所有秘密公式都致力于完整而完整地写作，如果他被带走，这项工作就可以不间断地继续下去。他向公司的一些官员展示了大量MSS的诱人一瞥。。。这样的事情自然让我对一些有价值的论文的存在抱有希望。"

The strange story of Keely's manuscripts and papers relating to his inventions does not end here. There was also another alleged storage of documents pertaining to him and his discoveries. Bloomfield-Moore left "immense files of writings concerning the motor, including a hundred letters to herself from Mr. Keely." But the story of what happened with these "immense files" is as strange, confusing and inconclusive as what happened with Keely's alleged 2,000 page manuscript.

基利的手稿和与他的发明有关的论文的离奇故事并没有就此结束。此外，据称还有另一批与他和他的发现有关的文件被存放。布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔留下了“大量关于汽车的文章，包括基利先生给自己的一百封信。”但这些“巨大文件”的故事与基利所谓的2000页手稿一样奇怪、令人困惑和没有结论。

More than half a century after his death and the ensuing tumult over his legacy, his nephew was located and interviewed. He was an old man at that time, and professed that he never had much confidence in Keely's experiments, but he recalled how Bloomfield-Moore sent "many of Keely's secrets" to Count von Rosen, CommanderCaptain in the Swedish Navy, then living in Scotland. He apparently sent this material to Stockholm in 1912, and nothing more was heard of these "secrets," although in 1972 a ring-bound volume was published there in which the foreword suggested that the book consisted of these materials, to which claim there is some circumstantial evidence.

在他去世半个多世纪后，以及随之而来的遗产风波之后，他的侄子被找到并接受了采访。当时他已经是一个老人了，他声称自己对基利的实验从来没有太多信心，但他回忆起布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔是如何将“基利的许多秘密”寄给当时居住在苏格兰的瑞典海军上尉冯·罗森伯爵的。他显然在1912年将这些材料寄给了斯德哥尔摩，但没有更多关于这些“秘密”的消息，尽管1972年在那里出版了一本环形装订的书，其中的前言表明这本书由这些材料组成，并声称有一些间接证据。

What these secrets originally consisted of, Keely's nephew did not care to explain. We are by no means sure that, given that Count von Rosen did indeed send the secret materials via Scotland to Sweden, that these were the "immense files" purportedly in possession of Bloomfield-Moore. Count von Rosen was a grandson of BloomfieldMoore; his father married Ella Carlton, the daughter of Bloomfield-Moore in 1864. While he was the executor of her estate, he was but one of the executors of her will. She left her manuscripts to "another grandson," his cousin Harold de Bildt, who acted as her literary executor.

这些秘密最初是由什么组成的，基利的侄子不愿意解释。鉴于冯·罗森伯爵确实通过苏格兰向瑞典发送了秘密材料，我们决不能确定这些是据称由布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔拥有的“巨大文件”。冯·罗森伯爵是布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔的孙子；1864年，他的父亲嫁给了布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔的女儿埃拉·卡尔顿。虽然他是她的遗产的执行人，但他只是她的遗嘱的执行人之一。她把手稿留给了“另一个孙子”，他的堂兄哈罗德·德·比尔特，他是她的文学遗嘱执行人。

Von Rosen told a reporter that Bloomfield-Moore "had no papers of which I know giving any idea of Keely's secret. Her papers are all here in the Fidelity Trust Company's care, and include the stock that she held in the motor company." He furthermore said that, when she learned of Keely's death, she "expressed a hope that he had imparted his secret to some one before he died." Based on his statements, although made long before he allegedly sent the secret materials to Sweden, we are left to assume that her files contained nothing of importance concerning, and directly relating to his inventions.

Von Rosen告诉记者，Bloomfield Moore“据我所知，没有任何文件透露Keely的秘密。她的文件都由富达信托公司保管，包括她在汽车公司持有的股票。”他还说，当她得知Keely的死讯时，她“表示希望他在死前把自己的秘密告诉了别人。”根据他的陈述，尽管早在据称他将秘密材料发送到瑞典之前就已经做出了陈述，但我们只能假设，她的档案中没有任何与他的发明有关或直接相关的重要内容。

Nevertheless, this may have given rise to the claims of Keely's nephew. The Count, while staying in Philadelphia, was "making some inquiries in regard to the motor, and says he will probably visit the old laboratory where Keely did his work before leaving the city."

It is also alleged that a Philadelphia occultist, Isaac Meyer, who wrote a learned treatise on the cabala may have held some files on Keely. Meyer apparently willed the New York Public Library 36 boxes of notes, books, translations and bibliographies. Most of this material concerns the research he did on the cabala. Although a large portion is said to have included collections on Keely and his inventions, nothing was found during a search.

然而，这可能导致了Keely侄子的索赔。伯爵在费城逗留期间，“正在对电机进行一些询问，并表示他可能会在离开该市之前参观基利工作的旧实验室。”

据称，费城神秘学家Isaac Meyer撰写了一篇关于阴谋集团的学术论文，他可能持有一些关于Keely的档案。迈耶显然向纽约公共图书馆捐赠了36箱笔记、书籍、翻译和书目。这些材料大多与他对阴谋集团所做的研究有关。尽管据说其中很大一部分包含了基利及其发明的藏品，但在搜索过程中一无所获。

And there the matter rests. Keely's mysterious manuscript disappeared into nothingness. The fate of the manuscript became shrouded in such an impenetrable mist so soon after the announcement was made that he left such materials, that one may even doubt if it ever existed at all. For even this is not entirely certain or conclusively proven, although as we have seen, it was suggested many times that it did indeed exist. His 1887 book is nowhere to be found; the ultimate fates of Bloomfield-Moore's "immense files" and Keely's "hundred letters" are equally shrouded in the same impenetrable mist.

事情到此为止。基利神秘的手稿消失在虚无之中。在宣布他留下这些材料后不久，手稿的命运就笼罩在一层无法穿透的迷雾中，人们甚至可能怀疑它是否存在。因为即使是这一点也不是完全确定或最终证明的，尽管正如我们所看到的，它确实存在过多次。他的1887年的书已无处可寻；布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔的《巨大档案》和基利的《百封信》的最终命运同样笼罩在难以穿透的迷雾中。

There were also Keely's engines, which by this time had also disappeared. It was stated on several occasions that Keely constructed and discarded 129 different models of his wonderful engines,50 while Keely himself once said that he had made "2,000 of them!"

还有基利的发动机，到这个时候也不见了。有人多次表示，Keely建造并丢弃了129种不同型号的奇妙发动机，其中50种是Keely自己制造的，而Keely本人曾表示他已经制造了“2000种！”

Many of the engines were no longer in existence because they were sold as "scrap iron" as Schuellerman stated. Babcock wrote: "many tons of these have been sold from time to time as old iron, brass and copper. One apparatus thus disposed of weighed twenty-two tons. Several similar ones, though somewhat lighter, have likewise gone to the scrap-heap. From this source money has often been raised by the inventor." With these funds, he was able to continue his researches at a time when the Keely Motor Company left him without any financial support. Not that he earned much money from the sale of his discarded devices. At one time Collier lamented that, "Our generator, which cost us \$60,000, we were forced to sell for \$200 as old form." Keely, or the companies that built his devices destroyed his older prototypes whenever a new, smaller and better one was built. This was customary from the beginning, and in 1881 Babcock remarked that, "had they all been preserved, (they) would make an interesting museum of mechanical curiosities."

正如舒尔曼所说，许多发动机已经不复存在，因为它们被当作“废铁”出售。巴布科克写道：“这些东西中有很多吨是作为旧铁、黄铜和铜不时出售的。这样处理的一台设备重达22吨。一些类似的设备虽然有些轻，但也被扔进了废料堆。发明家经常从这个来源筹集资金。” 有了这些资金，他得以在基利汽车公司没有任何资金支持的情况下继续研究。并不是说他通过出售被丢弃的设备赚了多少钱。科利尔曾哀叹道：“我们的发电机花了6万美元，但我们被迫以200美元的价格出售。” 基利，或者说，每当制造出一个新的、更小的、更好的原型时，制造他的设备的公司就会销毁他的旧原型。这从一开始就是惯例，1881年巴布科克评论道，“如果它们都被保存下来，（它们）将成为一个有趣的机械古玩博物馆。”

When stockholders obtained court orders against Keely in 1882, he destroyed many of his machines and drawings in fear of confiscation. When the courts threatened again in 1888, Keely destroyed several devices and valuable papers. When he was threatened with imprisonment by the Keely Motor Company, he not only destroyed a lot of his instruments "in a fit of despair," but also announced that "they may take his corpse to jail."

1882年，当股东们获得针对Keely的法庭命令时，他因担心被没收而销毁了许多机器和图纸。1888年，当法庭再次发出威胁时，基利销毁了一些装置和贵重文件。当他受到基利汽车公司的监禁威胁时，他不仅“在绝望中”销毁了许多仪器，还宣布“他们可能会把他的尸体送进监狱。”

Which devices he destroyed and which escaped destruction is impossible to say. Bloomfield-Moore confirms the destruction on those occasions, but from her statement we learn a little: "In the winter of 1881-82, when threatened with imprisonment by the managers of the Keely Motor Company for not disclosing his secret to them, which then would have been like pricking a bubble, he destroyed his vibratory lift and other instruments that he had been years in perfecting. At this time so hopeless was Keely, that his plans were made to destroy himself, after destroying his devices... .Again, in 1888.. .he broke up his vibratory microscope, his sympathetic transmitter, and some devices, which have taken much of his time to reconstruct." She too confirms that in 1882, "engine after engine was abandoned and sold as old metal in his repeated failures to construct one that would keep up the rotary motion of the ether that was necessary to hold it in any structure."

他摧毁了哪些装置，哪些逃脱了破坏，这是不可能的。Bloomfield Moore证实了这些场合的破坏，但从她的发言中，我们学到了一点：“1881-82年冬天，当基利汽车公司的经理们威胁要监禁他时，因为他们没有向他们透露他的秘密，这在当时就像刺破了一个泡沫，他摧毁了他多年来一直在完善的振动升降机和其他仪器。此时，基利是如此绝望，以至于他计划在摧毁他的设备后摧毁自己。。。。又一次，在1888年……他打碎了他的振动显微镜、交感神经发射器和一些设备，这些设备花了他很多时间来重建。“她也证实，在1882年，”一台又一台的发动机被遗弃，并作为旧金属出售，因为他一再未能建造出一台能够保持以太旋转运动的发动机，而这是将其固定在任何结构中所必需的。"

But what became of the devices that Keely did not destroy? Whether he constructed 129 or as many as 2,000, is a mystery. Various writers and researchers have put forward their own theories about the fates of those other wonderful engines. Most theories agree that the devices were taken out of Philadelphia to another location. It is alleged that Dr. Chase, who visited him when he was ill, took some fundamental pieces of machinery from his workshop to Boston for unknown reasons. A variant of this strange story had it that Dr. Chase returned some of those devices during an investigation of Keely's workshop by Clarence Moore and some scientists.

但是，基利没有销毁的设备后来怎么样了？他究竟建造了129座，还是多达2000座，这是个谜。许多作家和研究人员对这些其他奇妙引擎的命运提出了自己的理论。大多数理论都认为这些设备是从费城被带到另一个地方的。据称，Chase医生在他生病时探望了他，出于未知原因，将一些基本的机械部件从他的车间带到了波士顿。这个奇怪故事的一个变体是，在克拉伦斯·摩尔和一些科学家对基利工作室的调查中，蔡斯博士归还了其中一些设备。

It is also claimed that the machines were shipped to his workshop in Boston by a man named Konrade, but the engines didn't work there. Because Konrade wouldn't admit that he had failed, he claimed that he had discovered hidden levers and cogwheels, which were propelled through a water pump that he discovered in a nearby building. When we once again turn to the contemporary sources, we not only find that Dr. Chase was referred to only once, but that there never was a Konrade. One who did exist however, was T. Burton Kinraide of Boston. It was Kinraide who paid for the lot on the West Laurel Hill Cemetery where Keely found his final resting place.

据称，这些机器是由一个名叫Konrade的人运到他在波士顿的车间的，但发动机在那里不工作。因为Konrade不承认自己失败了，他声称自己发现了隐藏的杠杆和齿轮，这些杠杆和齿轮是通过他在附近建筑中发现的水泵推动的。当我们再次转向当代资料来源时，我们不仅发现Chase博士只被提及过一次，而且从来没有Konrade。然而，波士顿的T·伯顿·金雷德就是其中一位。是金雷德为西劳雷尔山公墓的墓地买单，基利在那里找到了最后的安息之地。

The subsequent fates of some of the engines are entangled with the strange story of Kinraide, which is embedded in that distressing period with its scandals, frustrations, hopes, accusations, and battles between the Keely Motor Company, Collier, Hill and Mrs. Keely over Keely's legacy.

一些发动机随后的命运与金雷德的离奇故事纠缠在一起，金雷德的丑闻、挫折、希望、指控以及基利汽车公司、科利尔、希尔和基利夫人之间关于基利遗产的斗争都植根于这段痛苦的时期。

The first direct reference to Kinraide without actually naming him—apart from his misspelled name in the list of pallbearers at the funeral—appeared in the press a week and a day after Keely's death. Kinraide "came on to Philadelphia after Mr. Keely died, was at the house every day between the death and the funeral; rode with Mrs. Keely in the same carriage to the cemetery and returned with her to the house. This alarming stranger is really not a stranger to the directors of the company. Several years ago, it is said, he appeared at the Keely establishment and has been a constant visitor and intimate of the family ever since. He remained on some of his visits as long as four or five weeks, during which time he devoted day after day to the study of the Keely motor, remaining in the room with it for hours at a time."

基利去世一周零一天后，除了他在葬礼抬棺人名单上拼写错误的名字外，第一次直接提到金雷德而没有实际说出他的名字出现在媒体上。基利先生死后，金瑞德来到费城，从去世到葬礼，他每天都在家里。Keely坐同一辆马车去了墓地，然后和她一起回到了家里。这个令人震惊的陌生人对公司的董事们来说真的并不陌生。据说，几年前，他出现在Keely餐厅，从那以后，他一直是这个家庭的常客和亲密伙伴。他在一些访问中停留了四五个星期，在这段时间里，他日复一日地研究基利运动，一次在房间里呆上几个小时。"

It seemed that the directors did not approve of this, but Keely was quoted as saying: "I can guard my secret all right." Nevertheless, a "full inquiry" was launched, to determine "the character and standing of Keely's mysterious friend."

The inquiry yielded some intriguing details: "It was discovered that he was a man of great wealth and lived in princely fashion in the vicinity of Boston. It was also learned that he was a scientist with theories of his own almost as remarkable as those advanced by Keely. Like Keely, he pursued discovery on the tones of vibration, and in order to conduct some special experiments, he had a huge cave hewn out of the solid rock on his estate, which he fitted up as a laboratory." While experimenting, he succeeded in obtaining rotary motion on the compass needle from vibrations.

导演们似乎并不赞成这一点，但报道援引基利的话说：“我可以很好地保守我的秘密。”尽管如此，还是展开了“全面调查”，以确定“基利神秘朋友的性格和地位”

调查得出了一些有趣的细节：“人们发现他是一个非常富有的人，在波士顿附近过着贵族般的生活。人们还了解到，他是一位科学家，他的理论几乎与基利提出的理论一样卓越。和基利一样，他也在探索振动的音调，为了进行一些特殊的实验，他在自己的庄园里用坚硬的岩石挖出了一个巨大的洞穴，他把它装成了实验室。“在实验中，他成功地从振动中获得了指南针的旋转运动。

It appears that stockholders in the Boston area already noticed this man: "On several occasions Boston stockholders in the Keely Motor Company wrote that Keely's ideas were being absorbed by a man who had already made a device similar in physical construction and operation. The apparatus was duplicated and forwarded to the directors, who handed it over to Mr. Keely. Keely laughed at it before them, but promised that he would take up the question. It was remarked after this that the friendship between the two men became closer than ever. The Boston scientist and man of means was at the Keely house every week, and it is alleged, is in the city at the present time..."

波士顿地区的股东似乎已经注意到了这个人：“有好几次，Keely Motor Company的波士顿股东写道，Keely的想法被一个已经制造出类似物理结构和操作的设备的人吸收了。基利。基利在他们面前笑了，但保证他会回答这个问题。后来有人说，这两个人之间的友谊比以往任何时候都更加亲密了。这位波士顿科学家和有钱人每周都在基利的房子里，据称，他现在在城里。。。"

A few days later, Collier revealed the name of this mysterious Bostonian, who had a huge grotto on his estate filled to the brim with weird and wonderful devices: "...The statement that a man who knew the inventor in life and who possessed the valuable secret was now in town was not denied by Mr. Collier. He said that this man was a Mr. Kincaid (sic) of Boston, and that he was an inventor himself. He frequently had interviews with Mr. Keely, Mr. Collier said, but it is unlikely that the inventor told him the secret of the famous motor." 

几天后，科利尔透露了这位神秘的波士顿人的名字，他在自己的庄园里有一个巨大的洞穴，里面装满了奇怪而奇妙的装置：“……科利尔先生没有否认一个认识这位发明家并拥有宝贵秘密的人现在在城里的说法他自己也是一名发明家。科利尔说，他经常采访基利，但这位发明家不太可能告诉他这台著名电机的秘密。"

On December 20, when the fighting over Keely's legacy had reached its peak and accusations flew high and wide, another reference to the mysterious man from Boston appeared during the annual meeting of the stockholders. It was also stated that he had known Keely since 1895: "Before the battle began, the statement spread that Keely had confided in T.B. Kinraid, (sic) of Boston, who had been summoned to the dying bed of the inventor. President Ackermann said he had been told by Charles S. Hill, attorney of Mrs. Keely, that Mr. Keely said that Kinraid was the one man who could carry on the work successfully. At this statement one stockholder stood up to say that three years ago he heard Mr. Keely say that Kinraid might know enough to be a little inventor, but that he was of no great ability."

12月20日，当围绕基利遗产的斗争达到顶峰，指控纷至沓来时，在股东年会上，又出现了一个关于这位来自波士顿的神秘男子的说法。还有人说，他从1895年起就认识了基利：“在战斗开始之前，基利向波士顿的T·B·金雷德（原文如此）吐露心声，金雷德被传唤到发明家的临终之床上。阿克曼总统说，基利夫人的律师查尔斯·S·希尔告诉他，基利先生说金雷德是唯一能成功完成这项工作的人。在这份声明中，一位股东站出来说，三年前，他听到基利先生说过，金雷德可能知道足够的知识，可以成为一个小发明家，但他没有太大的能力。”

Hill, the attorney of Keely's widow, outlined the plan of the estate, which was to place the machines and data in the hands of T.B. Kinraide. Apparently this was Mrs. Keely's plan: "It is Mrs. Keely's intention to have Mr. Kinraide give his entire time and his best abilities toward the completion of a practical engine, and he, until he has produced a machine capable of being patented..."

Keely遗孀的律师Hill概述了遗产计划，即将机器和数据交给T.B.Kinraide。显然，这是Keely夫人的计划：“Keely夫人打算让Kinraide先生全力以赴，完成一台实用的发动机，直到他生产出一台能够获得专利的机器……”

To all this, Hill also mentioned that this would happen within a year, at the end of which "he will present a report, supplemented by the allowance of an inspection of what he has done." Yet Hill was unclear of the time period: "Mr. Kinraide will work out the invention as the invention of John W. Keely, and will sign a contract to that effect... .Mr. Kinraide thinks he can determine in six weeks time whether he can bring the experiments to a successful issue."

Hill not only stated that he thought it unwise to have one group of people to have the sole control—"The Bloomfield-Moore and other interests have to be considered"—but also said that Kinraide "will make no promises that any machine will be completed...I can say that if this matter should be opposed the company is practically signing its own death warrant."

对于这一切，希尔还提到，这将在一年内发生，在这一年结束时，“他将提交一份报告，并对他所做的事情进行检查。”然而，希尔不清楚时间段：“金雷德先生将把这项发明作为约翰·W·基利的发明，并将签署一份合同。”。Kinraide认为他可以在六周内确定他是否能成功地进行实验。"

希尔不仅表示，他认为由一组人单独控制是不明智的——“必须考虑布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔和其他利益”——而且还表示，金莱德“不会承诺任何机器都会完工……我可以说，如果这件事遭到反对，该公司实际上是在签署自己的死刑令。”

Interestingly, this part of the final mystery holds a smaller mystery as well. A repetition of what happened to Boekel some fifteen years ago seems to have taken place. Somehow, Hill deemed it necessary to state at the meeting that "he had private information that would influence their decision, and that, in order to secure the cooperation of the members, he would disclose it in secret to one of their number. John J. Smith, of New York, was appointed to receive this secret, and held a conference with Mr. Hill."

While this is strange, considering the thunderous threats that Hill rained down upon the Board (why should he need the cooperation anyway) the outcome of the conference would be even more surprising.

有趣的是，最后一个谜团的这一部分也包含了一个较小的谜团。大约15年前发生在Boekel身上的事情似乎已经重演。不知怎的，希尔认为有必要在会议上声明，“他掌握了会影响他们决定的私人信息，为了确保成员们的合作，他将秘密披露给他们中的一个人。纽约的约翰·J·史密斯被任命接受这一秘密，并与希尔先生举行了一次会议。”

虽然这很奇怪，但考虑到希尔对董事会的雷鸣般的威胁（为什么他无论如何都需要合作），会议的结果将更加令人惊讶。

At the evening session, Mr. Smith made his report. He said that if he were the sole owner of the interests of the Keely Motor Company, he would make the same report, being that the suggestions of Mr. Hill be followed. "I think I have the Keely motor secret," said he, "but I shall use it no more for my own interests than for the interests of the company. In a short time, Mr. Kinraide will be able to tell whether he can work it out or not. From what I've seen today, I am thoroughly convinced that Mr. Kinraide can take those machines and operate them as Mr. Keely did, and produce the same results."

What was it that Smith learned and saw that totally convinced him, and even made him think that he now possessed Keely's secret? Smith did not disclose what he knew, and he kept his mouth shut tightly. For now!

在晚间会议上，史密斯先生作了报告。他说，如果他是Keely Motor Company利益的唯一所有者，他也会做出同样的报告，只是要遵循Hill先生的建议。“我想我掌握了基利汽车的秘密，”他说，“但我不会为了自己的利益，也不会为了公司的利益而使用它。在短时间内，金雷德先生将能够判断他是否能解决这个问题。从我今天所看到的情况来看，我完全相信金雷德先生可以像基利先生那样拿走这些机器并操作它们，并产生同样的结果。”

史密斯到底学到了什么，看到了什么，才完全相信了他，甚至让他认为自己现在掌握了基利的秘密？史密斯没有透露他所知道的情况，他守口如瓶。现在！

When Smith was selected, Hill "at first demurred to any selection..." and then made the following very strange remark: "You will rue the day you let the thing get out."

Collier tried his best shot and asked Hill if it were possible for Kinraide to "take those machines before a scientific body and operate them." Smith curtly stated that "it would be not advisable to do so, at this time." When Collier insisted, by stating that "for years and years we asked John W. Keely to make a demonstration before the Franklin Institute. Why can't it be done, now that we have somebody else at the head of the affairs?" Hill's reply was short: " As you have shown your confidence in me I shall have to ask you to consider that part of the matter closed for the present."

当史密斯被选中时，希尔“一开始对任何选择都表示反对……”然后说了一句非常奇怪的话：“你会后悔让事情败露的那一天。”

科利尔尽了最大努力，问希尔金雷德是否有可能“把这些机器带到科学机构面前并进行操作”。史密斯简短地说，“现在这样做是不明智的。”科利尔坚持说，“多年来，我们一直在问约翰·W。热衷于在富兰克林研究所做示范。既然我们有其他人负责这件事，为什么不能这样做？希尔的回答很简短：“由于你对我表现出了信心，我不得不请你考虑暂时结束这部分事务。”。"

The takeover by the men from Boston was now complete. Hill had eliminated any possible control of the Keely Motor Company over Keely's legacy. The fate of Keely's engines now lay in the hands of Kinraide, and no engine was to be exhibited. Meanwhile, Keely's engines were taken from the workshop and were placed in the vaults of the Land, Title and Trust Company, "fifteen of the more delicate pieces of machinery have been packed in flannel and removed for safety."

波士顿人的收购现在已经完成。希尔已经消除了基利汽车公司对基利遗产的任何可能控制。基利发动机的命运现在掌握在金雷德手中，没有发动机展出。与此同时，Keely的发动机被从车间里拿走，放在土地、所有权和信托公司的金库里，“为了安全起见，15台更精致的机器已经用法兰绒包装好，并被移走了。”

All the material and data would be placed in the hands of T.B. Kinraide, which "was the dying request of Keely." Kinraide was to have no compensation until he came up with some tangible results, and he was to have a year in which to produce these. Kinraide would also remove all appliances to his own laboratory in Boston at his own expense. According to Hill, Kinraide would be able to tell "in a very few weeks...whether or not he can successfully complete the Keely inventions."

所有的材料和数据都将交给T.B.Kinraide，这“是Keely最后的要求”。在Kinraide拿出一些切实的成果之前，他将没有任何补偿，他将有一年的时间来制作这些成果。Kinraide还将自费将所有设备转移到他位于波士顿的实验室。根据希尔的说法，金雷德将能够在“几周内……判断他是否能成功完成基利的发明。”

What could the stockholders do but to "have resolved to allow T.B. Kinraide, of Boston, to continue the work left unfinished by Mr. Keely...," and, puzzled enough by all this, declare that, "The man who is to take up work on the mysterious motor is said to have enjoyed the fullest confidence of the deceased inventor, and had a knowledge of the experiments."

股东们除了“决定允许波士顿的T.B.Kinraide继续Keely先生未完成的工作……”之外还能做什么呢？他们对此感到非常困惑，并宣布，“据说，负责研究神秘电机的人得到了已故发明家的充分信任，并对实验有所了解。”

The directors of the company thought otherwise. They were extremely skeptical, "to say the least, of Mr. Kinraide's ability to make any progress, inasmuch as they believe that he does not know Keely's secret... Keely was eccentric. He refused to divulge the one secret idea, which, he said, was the basis of all his experiments, even to his closest associates. Charles B. Collier and Lancaster Thomas, who for many years stood by Keely, while they were privy to many of his plans and had free access to his workshop, were never acquainted with the mysterious 'vitalizing force'—Keely's secret, and they are firm in their belief that Mr. Kinraide or no other person knows it."

公司的董事们却不以为然。至少可以说，他们对金雷德先生取得任何进展的能力极为怀疑，因为他们认为他不知道基利的秘密……基利很古怪。他拒绝透露一个秘密想法，他说，这个想法是他所有实验的基础，甚至是他最亲密的伙伴。科利尔和兰开斯特·托马斯多年来一直支持基利，虽然他们知道基利的许多计划，并可以自由进入他的工作室，但他们从未了解神秘的‘振兴力量’——基利的秘密，他们坚信金雷德先生或其他人都不知道。”

A dry conjecture of the situation was published a week later in a short editorial in a Philadelphia newspaper: "It appears that we must wait another year to learn the secret of the Keely motor, and we may not learn it even then. A Boston man who is supposed to have penetrated farther into the mystery than anybody else has been entrusted with the task of completing Keely's great life work—if he can. He is not entirely confident of himself, but it is agreed that if he cannot make the motor mote, nobody can, and he is to have a year for the trial."

一周后，费城一家报纸发表了一篇简短的社论，对这种情况进行了枯燥的推测：“看来，我们必须再等一年才能知道基利马达的秘密，即使到那时我们也可能学不到。一个波士顿人被赋予了完成基利一生伟大工作的任务——如果可以的话。他对自己并不完全有信心，但人们一致认为，如果他不能制造出马达，没有人能、 他将有一年的时间接受审判。"

More specifically, Kinraide said that if at the end of one year he was convinced that there was absolutely nothing that would lead to a practical machine he would abandon his attempts. "If it is shown that there are clues enough to lead to the construction of such an engine it will be pushed rapidly forward to the patentable stage and further agreements made. Mr. Kinraide will make no agreement that any machine or engine will be completed at a certain time, or even that one will be completed at all. He will simply devote one year to try to solve the secret possessed by Keely. The work will be done at Mr. Kinraide's laboratory here, and during his working hours he will be inaccessible to all callers."

更具体地说，Kinraide说，如果在一年结束时，他确信绝对没有什么能产生实用的机器，他将放弃他的尝试。“如果能证明有足够的线索来建造这样一个发动机，它将迅速进入可申请专利的阶段，并达成进一步的协议。Kinraide不会同意任何机器或发动机将在某个时间完成，甚至根本不会完成。他只需花一年的时间试图解开基利所拥有的秘密。这项工作将在金雷德先生的实验室完成，在他的工作时间里，所有来电者都无法联系到他。"

On December 28, Keely's engines were shipped to Boston. But, contrary to what researchers suggest, not all of Keely's engines were to go to Kinraide's laboratory: "All the devices of the late John W. Keely that are held to be of importance in connection with the experiments to be made by T.B. Kinraide of Boston, will be shipped today, to be placed in his laboratory. The more delicate machines and parts have been in safe keeping in the vaults of the Land Title and Trust Company, having been placed there shortly after the death of Mr. Keely. Charles S. Hill, of Boston, attorney for Mrs. Keely, was in the city yesterday, and with Mr. Kinraide supervised the work of moving the machines. ...Mr. Hill says that the older machines and those which Mr. Kinraide believes will be of no practical value in his work will be stored by the Keely Motor Company in this city, and that a room will be rented for that purpose." Hill personally escorted Keely's engines to Boston, where he arrived a day later.

12月28日，Keely的发动机被运往波士顿。但是，与研究人员的建议相反，并不是Keely的所有发动机都会被送到Kinraide的实验室：“已故约翰·W·基利的所有设备都被认为与T.B.的实验有关。波士顿的Kinraide，将于今天发货，放置在他的实验室中。Keely先生去世后不久，这些更精密的机器和零件被安全存放在土地所有权和信托公司的金库中。来自波士顿的查尔斯·S·希尔是基利夫人的律师，他昨天在该市，与金雷德先生一起监督机器的移动工作。。。Hill先生说，这些旧机器和Kinraide先生认为在他的工作中没有实际价值的机器将由Keely Motor Company存放在这个城市，并将为此租用一个房间。" 希尔亲自护送基利的引擎前往波士顿，一天后他抵达波士顿。

Keely's inventory, filed on January 3, the same day that his devices arrived in Boston, made a reference to "Fifteen pieces of experimental apparatus." A Boston newspaper wrote that "Twenty large packing cases have arrived here, containing the material part of the famous Keely motor. T.B. Kinraide, an inventor, ordered the boxes removed to his laboratory. There he will experiment in trying to supply whatever is lacking in mechanism."

Keely的库存于1月3日提交，也就是他的设备抵达波士顿的同一天，其中提到了“15件实验仪器”。波士顿一家报纸写道，“20个大包装箱已经抵达这里，里面装着著名的Keely电机的材料部分。Kinraide，一位发明家，下令将这些盒子移到他的实验室。在那里，他将尝试提供机制上缺乏的任何东西。"

Kinraide also told a reporter that, "he had often talked with Mr. Keely on the principles of his invention. He never fully explained the secret of his perpetual motion to me, said Mr. Kinraide, but I feel that I know more of the motor than any other man. Mr. Keely, after being taken ill, expressed the wish that I be allowed to carry out his inventions. Before the hour set for the interview had arrived the inventor was past recovery. It was, however, at Mr. Keely's request and that of Mrs. Keely that I have consented to conduct these experiments. I am not a director of the company, neither am I an employee of the directors in any sense. I am not hired to do the work which I have undertaken. So far, all I have done has been at my expense."

Kinraide还告诉记者，“他经常和Keely先生谈论他的发明原理。他从来没有向我充分解释过他永动机的秘密，”Kinraide先生说，但我觉得我比任何其他人都更了解这种电机。基利在生病后，表示希望我能完成他的发明。面试时间还没到，这位发明家就已经康复了。然而，正是在基利先生和基利夫人的要求下，我才同意进行这些实验。我不是公司的董事，也不是任何意义上的董事的雇员。我不是被雇来做我所承担的工作的。到目前为止，我所做的一切都是以我为代价的。"

So Keely's engines, which were already crated on December 20, were stored in two places. The contents of 20 large crates were on Kinraide's estate on Jamaica Plain in the vicinity of Boston, where his laboratory was situated, and in Philadelphia, where Keely's "mechanical property" was removed and stored in a building on North Broad Street. Apart from the machinery that was moved to Boston, the "heavier apparatus" was relocated to a storehouse at Broad and Vine Streets, possibly the same storehouse on Broad Street. Elsewhere it is written that the storehouse was located at Broad Street and Fairmont Avenue. In a safe deposit vault at the Land Title and Trust Company, Keely's disintegrator and other "fine pieces of machinery," his sensitized disks, wires, etc. were placed. Before being placed in the vault, the disintegrator made a short stop at the Hotel Stratford, were it was examined by Smith, Kinraide and Hill.

因此，Keely的发动机在12月20日就已经装进了板条箱，存放在两个地方。20个大板条箱的内容物分别在金雷德位于波士顿附近牙买加平原的庄园和费城，在那里，基利的“机械财产”被移走并存放在北布罗德街的一栋建筑中。除了被转移到波士顿的机器外，“较重的设备”也被转移到布罗德街和葡萄街的一个仓库，可能是布罗德街的同一个仓库。其他地方写着仓库位于布罗德街和费尔蒙特大道。在土地所有权和信托公司的一个保险库中，放置了Keely的分解器和其他“精细机械”，他的感光盘、电线等。在被放入保险库之前，分解器在斯特拉特福德酒店短暂停留，接受了Smith、Kinraide和Hill的检查。

Perhaps a detailed inventory was made of the remaining devices at the time of his death, showing which devices Kinraide obtained, but if so, it did not survive. We are therefore left with superficial descriptions that Kinraide obtained the "remarkable machines, vibrators, lever machine and others used by Keely." It was suggested that Kinraide also obtained his latest engine, the work on which was almost finished by William F. Rudolf at the time of Keely's death, and that resembled the Globe Motor but only larger, with a two feet copper globe weighing 75 pounds and the mechanism made out of decarbonized steel weighing 600 pounds.

也许在他去世时，对剩余的设备进行了详细的清点，显示了Kinraide获得了哪些设备，但如果是这样，它就没有存活下来。因此，我们只剩下肤浅的描述，即金雷德获得了“基利使用的非凡机器、振动器、杠杆机和其他机器”。有人认为，金雷德还获得了他最新的发动机，在基利去世时，威廉·F·鲁道夫几乎完成了这项工作，它类似于环球汽车，但只是更大，一个两英尺重75磅的铜球和一个由重达600磅的脱碳钢制成的机构。

Behind the scene, the battle over the rights of ownership of the engines continued. Hill stated to a reporter that, "Whatever the property rights may be, that question will remain in abeyance. The company has simply agreed to turn over the machines to Mr. Kinraide for his experiments."

On January 3, 1899, an inventory of Keely's personal estate was filed with Register of Wills Hackett: "An inventory of the personal estate of the late inventor John W. Keely, the appraisal being placed at \$1,536." The only reference to the famous motor was the following unspecified clause: "Fifteen pieces of experimental apparatus, a certain right of unknown valuation in certain uncompleted and unpatented inventions."

在幕后，争夺发动机所有权的斗争仍在继续。希尔向一名记者表示，“无论产权是什么，这个问题都将被搁置。该公司只是同意将机器移交给金雷德先生进行实验。”

1899年1月3日，Keely的个人财产清单被提交给遗嘱登记处Hackett：“已故发明家John W.Keely的私人财产清单，估价为1536美元。”唯一提到这辆著名的汽车的是以下未指明的条款：“十五件实验装置，对某些未完成和未获得专利的发明享有某种未知的估价权。”

On January 29, 1899, precisely a month after some of the devices reached Jamaica Plain, Hill issued a remarkable statement to the press. Hill timed his statement well. At the same time the newspaper ran a huge article, together with detailed drawings and elaborate explanations of Keely's exposure as a fraud. In the article, Hill's statement received considerable space. "...It was arranged between the president of the Keely Motor Company and myself that on December 20, 1898, I should address the stockholders, giving my views, as Mrs. Keely's counsel, as to the best course to pursue. Shortly after this agreement, while examining the laboratory, Mr. Kinraide discovered the first evidence of fraud. Till that moment our confidence in Mr. Keely's integrity and honor was as firm as any of his friends who had invested thousands. Here was a new element, that of self-evident fraud, affecting, however, only one machine, and not vitiating, so far as we knew, any other of the numerous machines Mr. Keely employed." Surprisingly, J.J. Smith, who claimed to know "Keely's Secret," accompanied Hill and Kinraide and also delivered a damning statement. Was this the secret that he came to know?

1899年1月29日，就在一些装置抵达牙买加平原一个月后，希尔向新闻界发表了一份引人注目的声明。希尔的发言时机恰到好处。与此同时，该报发表了一篇大文章，并附上了详细的图纸和对Keely被揭露为骗子的详细解释。在文章中，希尔的发言获得了相当大的篇幅。“……基利汽车公司总裁和我本人约定，1898年12月20日，我应向股东发表讲话，作为基利夫人的律师，就最佳做法发表意见。在达成协议后不久，在检查实验室时，金雷德先生发现了第一个欺诈证据。基利的正直和荣誉与他投资数千美元的朋友一样坚定。这是一个新的因素，那就是不言而喻的欺诈，然而，它只影响一台机器，而据我们所知，并没有破坏基利先生使用的众多机器中的任何其他机器。“令人惊讶的是，声称知道《基利的秘密》的J·J·史密斯陪同希尔和金莱德，还发表了一份谴责性的声明。这就是他所知道的秘密吗？”

Another character, J. Ransom Bridge from Philadelphia, came forward and said that, "When Mr. T. Burton Kinraide took charge of Keely's laboratory one of the first discoveries was how Mr. Keely did his experiments. He could vary the initial performance in a dozen ways, but the principle was always the same."

另一个角色，来自费城的J.Ransom Bridge站出来说：“当T.Burton Kinraide先生负责Keely的实验室时，最早的发现之一是Keely先生是如何进行实验的。他可以通过十几种方式改变最初的表现，但原理总是一样的。”

The statements of Hill, Smith and Bridge should have settled the matter, but it didn't. Strangely, Kinraide vehemently disagreed with Hill's statement. Kinraide was "greatly surprised that Mr. Hill had written anything against the Keely motor, and refused to say anything" until he saw Mr. Hill, as he doubted the validity of the report. He was unable to find Mr. Hill, but consulted his lawyer instead. On the advice of his counsel he declined to give out anything further than this statement, which was carefully written out: "If, as you inform me, Mr. Hill has made a pretended expose of the Keely motor in the New York Journal, and used my name in connection therewith, he has done so without my knowledge or assent, and I consider it a gross outrage and a dastardly breach of faith."

希尔、史密斯和布里奇的声明本应解决此事，但事实并非如此。奇怪的是，金雷德强烈反对希尔的声明。Kinraide“对Hill先生写了任何反对Keely汽车的文章感到非常惊讶，并拒绝说任何话”，直到他见到Hill先生，因为他怀疑报告的有效性。他找不到希尔先生，而是咨询了他的律师。在律师的建议下，他拒绝透露除这份精心撰写的声明之外的任何其他内容：“如果你告诉我，希尔先生在《纽约日报》上假装曝光了Keely汽车，并使用了我的名字，他是在我不知情或不同意的情况下这样做的，我认为这是严重的愤怒和卑鄙的失信行为。”

Bridge answered that the knowledge of the fraud was "imparted to him without solicitation or request," and that he made no promise of secrecy and was under no obligation to keep silent. He also claimed that, "In addition to the evidences of fraud which I saw in Mr. Keely's laboratory in Philadelphia I also have seen since Mr. Keely's death the most important of the experiments performed by Mr. Kinraid (sic) himself. Mr. Kinraid told both Mr. Hill and myself that plain evidences of fraud covered every experiment done by Mr. Keely and as we had ocular demonstrations of the tricks we could not doubt the statement."

布里奇回答说，对欺诈的了解是“在没有征求或请求的情况下告知他的”，他没有承诺保密，也没有义务保持沉默。他还声称，“除了我在费城Keely先生的实验室看到的欺诈证据外，自Keely先生去世以来，我还看到了Kinraid先生自己进行的最重要的实验。基利，当我们对这些把戏进行了直观的演示时，我们不能怀疑这一说法。"

Be that as it may, puzzled and alarmed stockholders told a reporter that they wanted to determine whether or not Mr. Kinraide believed that Keely's work was fraudulent. If he thought so, they wanted the machines returned to Philadelphia. And indeed they were puzzled by a certain ambiguity: "If it was known that the Keely machines were fraudulent, why were they taken on to Boston, and why was it held out that it would take Mr. Kinraide time to probe into the matter, and that it might take a year?"

The same day, Thomas Collier, who the year before had so boldly claimed that he could build a machine similar to Keely's devices, and Rudolf, the man who built Keely's latest engine, visited Kinraide's laboratory in order to "satisfy themselves that the Keely machines are in the same condition as when they left the laboratory in this city."

尽管如此，困惑和惊慌的股东告诉记者，他们想确定金雷德先生是否认为基利的作品是欺诈性的。如果他这么认为的话，他们希望这些机器能回到费城。事实上，他们对某种模糊性感到困惑：“如果知道Keely机器是欺诈性的，为什么他们会被带到波士顿，为什么会认为Kinraide先生需要时间来调查此事，而且可能需要一年时间？”

同一天，托马斯·科利尔（Thomas Collier）和鲁道夫（Rudolf）参观了金雷德的实验室，以“确信基利的机器与他们离开这个城市的实验室时处于相同的状态”

Rudolph, on his return from Boston, said that he would be going back "to continue the investigation set on foot by the directors." More could not be learned from him, as he did "not intend to give out any information, as it was the decision of the whole committee that we should say nothing in advance."

鲁道夫从波士顿回来后表示，他将回去“继续董事们展开的调查”。无法从他那里了解到更多信息，因为他“不打算透露任何信息，因为这是整个委员会的决定，我们不应该提前说任何话。”

On February 29, at a meeting of the Board held at the company's office at 913 Walnut St., Collier told the assembly that "the motor is now at Jamaica Plain near Boston, in the keeping of T.B. Kinraide: ...we will follow the events at Jamaica Plain with interest. "  So at that time, the part of Keely's equipment that was shipped to Kinraide was still in the cave in Jamaica Plain near Boston, and we must assume that the rest of Keely's devices were still located in the vaults in Philadelphia.

2月29日，在位于核桃街913号的公司办公室举行的董事会会议上，科利尔告诉大会，“电机现在在波士顿附近的牙买加平原，由T.B.金雷德保管：……我们将饶有兴趣地关注牙买加平原的事件。”因此，当时，运往金雷德的Keely设备部分仍在波士顿附近牙买加平原的洞穴中，我们必须假设Keely的其余设备仍位于费城的金库中。

For four months, everybody, including the newspapers, was silent about Kinraide and his experiments with Keely's engines, and the status of the devices in Philadelphia. On July 16, 1899, the cloak of silence would be lifted, but under very unusual circumstances. The event announced its coming in a short notice in Scientific American: "Mr. Kinraide, of Jamaica Plain, Mass., has abandoned all work on the Keely motor, and will ship back to the Keely Motor Company all the machines and manuscripts left by Keely. Mr. Kinraide was on terms of some intimacy with Keely, and it was thought that he might discover, if possible, some virtue in the motor. The exposure of the frauds which Keely perpetrated in his Philadelphia laboratory, which we have already illustrated, has helped to induce Mr. Kinraide to abandon the whole matter."

四个月来，包括报纸在内的所有人都对金雷德和他对基利发动机的实验以及这些设备在费城的状况保持沉默。1899年7月16日，沉默的外衣将被揭开，但这是在非常不寻常的情况下。该活动在《科学美国人》杂志上很快宣布：“来自马萨诸塞州牙买加平原的Kinraide先生已经放弃了Keely电机的所有工作，并将把Keely留下的所有机器和手稿运回Keely电机公司。金雷德与基利关系密切，人们认为，如果可能的话，他可能会在这辆汽车上发现一些美德。基利在费城实验室犯下的欺诈行为被曝光，我们已经说明了这一点，这有助于促使金雷德先生放弃整个事情。"

This statement offers more puzzlement than clarification. Just when one is about to frustratingly dismiss the whole manuscript-affair out of pure lack of further information, it appears from the article that Kinraide did have manuscripts left by Keely. Were these Keely's mysterious diaries which were, as a newspaper had written, given to Kinraide by his widow? And why would Kinraide abandon the work due to the news of the alleged exposure by Moore and his team? Kinraide disagreed with Hill's version of the confusing tale, even going so far as to consult his lawyer. And how about his experiments with Keely's engines? The eagerly awaited report finally came on July 16, almost two months after the allegation that Kinraide would ship the engines back to Philadelphia.

这句话给人的困惑多于澄清。就在人们纯粹因为缺乏进一步的信息而沮丧地驳回整个手稿事件的时候，从文章中可以看出，Kinraide确实有Keely留下的手稿。这些是基利的神秘日记吗？正如一家报纸所写的那样，这些日记是他的遗孀送给金雷德的吗？为什么Kinraide会因为Moore和他的团队曝光的消息而放弃这项工作？Kinraide不同意Hill对这个令人困惑的故事的说法，甚至咨询了他的律师。他用基利的发动机做的实验怎么样？人们翘首以盼的报告终于在7月16日发布，距离Kinraide将把发动机运回费城的指控已经过去了将近两个月。

The circumstances in which Kinraide delivered his report were unusual. First, his report was not delivered by himself as one would have expected, but by Clarence B. Moore, the son of Bloomfield-Moore. And second, he did not obtain the report directly from Kinraide. Moore's informant was "a well-known gentleman" from Philadelphia who had invested "heavily in the stock of the alleged motor, and who recently paid Mr. Kinraide a visit at his laboratory." Kinraide told this anonymous informant that Keely had not discovered a new force, and demonstrated his claim "to the satisfaction of his visitor." Kinraide made this informant promise not to make public the information given to him, but he did, "however, receive permission to report the result of the investigation to Mr. Moore." This is strange, since Kinraide could have known that Moore, whose antagonistic views about Keely were well known at that time, would head straight for the press.

金雷德提交报告的情况非同寻常。首先，他的报告并不是像人们所期望的那样由他自己提交的，而是由布鲁姆菲尔德·摩尔的儿子克拉伦斯·B·摩尔提交的。其次，他没有直接从金莱德那里获得报告。摩尔的线人是来自费城的“一位知名绅士”，他“在所谓的汽车库存上投入了大量资金，最近还拜访了金雷德先生的实验室。”金雷德告诉这位匿名线人，基利没有发现新的力量，并“让来访者满意”地证明了他的说法金莱德让这位线人承诺不公开提供给他的信息，但他确实“获得了向摩尔先生报告调查结果的许可”。这很奇怪，因为金莱德本可以知道摩尔会直接向媒体发表言论，因为当时摩尔对基利的敌对观点是众所周知的。

And so Moore did. He told a reporter that "Mr. T.B. Kinraide, of Jamaica Plain, Boston, on whom the mantle of Keely was supposed to have fallen, and who actually did receive the Keely motor mechanism early in January, admits that the motor was a fraud, that the machinery was moved by well-known forces, and that the duplication of Keely's 'demonstrations' is a simple matter. When Mr. Kinraide was reported, a short time ago, to have returned the Keely motor machinery to Philadelphia, the inevitable conclusion was forced on any one conversant with the history of the Keely motor that Mr. Kinraide, having discovered the nature of the fraud, washed his hands of the whole affair. It seems however, that Mr. Kinraide did not send the apparatus back, but got to the heart of the delusion by a careful study of the motors in hand."

摩尔也这么做了。他告诉一名记者，“波士顿牙买加平原的T.B.Kinraide先生，Keely的衣钵本应落在他身上，实际上他在一月初收到了Keely的马达装置，他承认马达是一个骗局，机器是由知名力量移动的，重复Keely的‘示威’很简单。据报道，不久前，Kinraide已将Keely汽车机械归还费城，任何熟悉Keely汽车历史的人都不得不得出一个不可避免的结论，即Kinraide先生在发现欺诈行为的性质后，对整个事件洗手不干。然而，Kinraide先生似乎并没有把仪器送回来，而是通过仔细研究手中的电机，找到了错觉的核心。"

According to the unnamed informant, during this "careful study" Kinraide set up the machine room in his cave at Jamaica Plain "almost exactly after the manner of Keely's, suggesting that he had begun on the premise that he must reproduce the whole thing if desirous of success." Then, Kinraide walked around the machines for some time, and "at last he turned and smilingly remarked that he might excel Keely at his own trickery if he had the same fluency of words as the latter."

据这位不愿透露姓名的线人说，在这项“仔细研究”期间，金雷德在牙买加平原的洞穴里“几乎完全按照基利的方式”建立了机房，这表明他开始的前提是，如果他想要成功，就必须复制整件事。”然后，金雷德绕着机器走了一段时间，最后，他转过身来，微笑着说，如果他能像基利那样流利地说话，他可能会擅长自己的诡计。”

Kinraide applied compressed air, hydraulic pressure and a powerful spring, and even a magnet, concealed in the wall. The hydraulic pressure and compressed air came from "hidden sources." With the help of all this, Kinraide obtained the same results. "One of the most unique pieces of mechanism I found in Philadelphia," Kinraide reportedly said, "was a spring to wind using a key as big as a crowbar." With the proper winding the spring would be able to "run for three or four days," and produces enormous energy. Kinraide also showed how he could start the hydraulic and compressed air pressure by picking up a violin, after which the "instrument wheels began to revolve," because he touched "a bulb," hidden under the floor at the same time.

Kinraide施加了压缩空气、液压和强大的弹簧，甚至还有隐藏在墙上的磁铁。液压和压缩空气来自“隐藏的来源”。在这一切的帮助下，Kinraide获得了同样的结果。据报道，Kinraide说：“我在费城发现的最独特的机械装置之一是一个弹簧，它可以用撬棍那么大的钥匙上弦。”如果上弦得当，弹簧可以“运行三四天”，并产生巨大的能量。Kinraide还展示了他如何通过拿起小提琴来启动液压和压缩空气压力，之后，“仪器轮子开始转动”，因为他同时触摸了隐藏在地板下的“灯泡”。

It took the unnamed informant nearly eight hours in Kinraide's laboratory, "and when the Philadelphian emerged he was convinced that he had lost his investment." Kinraide repeated that those who would produce evidence of being "victimized," could obtain an invitation to visit Kinraide's laboratory at Jamaica Plain and "see the whole thing disclosed." Kinraide refused entrance to reporters, "for it has been decreed that, as far as the public is concerned, the Keely affair can rest in peace and the Keely victims have their sorrows to themselves."

这位未透露姓名的线人在金雷德的实验室里呆了将近八个小时，“当这位费城人出现时，他确信自己失去了投资。”金雷德重申，那些愿意提供“受害”证据的人可以获得访问金雷德位于牙买加平原的实验室的邀请，并“看到整个事情被披露”。金雷德拒绝记者进入，“因为已经颁布法令，就公众而言，基利事件可以平静下来，基利受害者自己也有悲伤。”

This, of course, was a strange thing as well, since this effectively barred all further verification of Kinraide's claims. It also made no sense, since everything was published in the newspapers anyway. A newspaper remarked that, "The announcement of Mr. Kinraide's present conviction is all well enough so far as it goes, but in the premises Mr. Kinraide certainly owes it to the world of science to make a full and complete report on his examination of the Keely machinery and his reasons for his belief that the motor is to be classed among the great frauds of the present century. In this issue Mr. Kinraide has not only a responsibility to himself but to the public. So long as he kept quiet after he discovered the fraudulent character of the motor so long was he, doubtless unintentionally, aiding in maintaining a delusion. So it seems he has spoken his mind freely but privately. This is where he errs. He should go on public record."

当然，这也是一件奇怪的事情，因为这实际上阻止了对Kinraide说法的所有进一步核实。这也毫无意义，因为所有的东西都在报纸上发表了。一家报纸评论道：“就目前而言，宣布金雷德先生被定罪已经足够了，但在这个前提下，金雷德先生当然要感谢科学界，就他对基利机械的检查以及他认为该电机应被列为本世纪最大欺诈之一的理由，做出一份完整而完整的报告。”。金雷德不仅对自己负有责任，而且对公众负有责任。只要他在发现马达的欺诈性后保持沉默，那么他无疑是无意中帮助维持了一种错觉。看来他是在私下里畅所欲言。这就是他犯错的地方。他应该公开记录在案。"

It was also remarked that, although others, scientists and the like, had already made their minds up that Keely was a fraud, Kinraide had one advantage; "he and not they had the machinery to work over... .For this reason a brochure entitled 'Kinraide on Keely' ought to be issued. To keep quiet is not scientific and savors of disingenousness."

还有人说，尽管其他人，科学家等已经下定决心认为Keely是个骗子，但Kinraide有一个优势；“他而不是他们有机器可以操作……因此，应该发布一本名为《基利的Kinraide》的小册子。保持沉默是不科学的，有虚伪的味道。”

It was also suggested that Keely's machinery should, if possible, be sent to a museum, "in Philadelphia preferably."108 And since this suggestion was published almost two months after the statement in Scientific American that Kinraide would ship Keely's devices back to the Keely Motor Company, we may conclude that no such thing occurred until that time. It seems that in the end, nothing came of this. The newspapers fell silent once more, and after a while, lost all interest. And although Scientific American had announced the return of Keely's engines to Philadelphia, no Philadelphia newspaper in the months to come mentioned their delivery to that city.

还有人建议，如果可能的话，Keely的机器应该被送到博物馆，“最好是在费城。”108由于这一建议是在《科学美国人》杂志发表声明称Kinraide将把Keely的设备运回Keely汽车公司近两个月后发表的，我们可以得出结论，在那之前没有发生过这样的事情。似乎最后，一切都没有结果。报纸又一次沉寂了下来，过了一会儿，失去了所有的兴趣。尽管《科学美国人》杂志已经宣布将Keely的发动机归还费城，但在未来几个月里，没有一家费城报纸提到他们将运往该市。

Several months before, an intriguing notice appeared in a Philadelphia newspaper in which Keely's brother, J.A. Keely of New York, told a reporter that the secret was known to "an inventor and electrician of Asbury Park," a Richard Croker, to whom it was shown five years previously upon an oath that he would not divulge it "as long as Keely was alive." Keely's brother was now "negotiating with this man for the manufacture of the motor." Nothing more was published in the coming months and years. Keely's brother once again wandered off into the pages of history, and we hear no more of him or the electrician of Asbury Park.

几个月前，费城一家报纸上出现了一则有趣的通知，Keely的哥哥、纽约的J.a.Keely在通知中告诉一名记者，这个秘密为“阿斯伯里公园的发明家和电工”Richard Croker所知，五年前，他向Richard Croker展示了这个秘密，并发誓“只要Keely还活着”，他就不会泄露Keely的哥哥现在正在“与这个人就发动机的制造进行谈判”。 在接下来的几个月和几年里，没有更多的消息发表。基利的哥哥再次走进历史的篇章，我们再也听不到他或阿斯伯里公园的电工的消息了。

The whereabouts of Keely's engines which were shipped to a cave somewhere on an estate on Jamaica Plain and the heavier ones that were stored in Philadelphia were lost in the mist of time, and there the mystery remains. Conventional contemporary sources offer no further explanation.

基利的发动机被运到牙买加平原某个庄园的一个洞穴里，而存放在费城的较重的发动机则在时间的迷雾中消失了，神秘的东西仍然存在。传统的当代资料没有提供进一步的解释。

It is not known what happened to devices such as the huge aerial propeller, on which Keely worked as late as 1895. His aerial propeller, for instance (a description of this huge construction will follow in chapter 8) is strangely absent in contemporary accounts relating to the removal of his engines. No mention is made of either the destruction or the removal of the aerial propeller. Taking the sudden loss of interest of the conventional contemporary sources into account, we might speculate that Keely's devices were dispersed as time went by, and subsequent generations lost all curiosity in his incomprehensible inventions when even the memory of Keely himself became a thing of the past.

目前尚不清楚Keely直到1895年还在其上工作的巨大空中螺旋桨等设备发生了什么。例如，他的空中螺旋桨（对这一巨大建筑的描述将在第8章中介绍）奇怪地没有出现在与拆除发动机有关的当代报道中。没有提及摧毁或拆除空中螺旋桨的情况。考虑到传统的当代来源突然失去了兴趣，我们可以推测，随着时间的推移，Keely的设备被分散了，当连Keely自己的记忆都成为过去时，后代对他令人费解的发明失去了所有的好奇心。

But as we will see in the chapter on Keely's connections with the occult undercurrents—and there were many—it is from those quarters that at least one, although an altogether very different, solution to this mystery is offered. For while conventional sources such as the contemporary newspapers were quite satisfied with repeating Moore's allegations that Keely was a fraud, and investigative journalism does not seem to have been a virtue in the Keely history, it is in the occult quarters that a very different story was told. There it is alluded to that interested parties, who went to a great deal of effort to remain anonymous, did see the enormous significance of Keely's discoveries and his engines, and took great care of collecting and hiding his devices from public view.

但正如我们将在关于Keely与神秘暗流的联系的一章中看到的那样——有很多——正是从这些方面，至少提供了一个解决这个谜团的方法，尽管完全不同。因为尽管当代报纸等传统来源对重复摩尔关于基利是骗子的指控感到非常满意，而调查性新闻似乎在基利的历史上并不是一种美德，但正是在神秘的地方，讲述了一个完全不同的故事。在那里，有人暗示，为了保持匿名，相关方付出了巨大的努力，他们确实看到了Keely的发现和他的引擎的巨大意义，并非常小心地收集和隐藏他的设备，使其不被公众看到。

There is a suspicious incident that may give the viewpoint of these occult quarters some weight. In 1910, Astor—who fifteen years before had wanted to finance Keely to the extent of several millions—was reported to have docked a "mysterious craft" in the Harlem River. A newspaper stated that the craft "seemed to embody an airship with a practical watercraft."  As reporters were kept away and no other information seems to have surfaced on this subject, we can only wonder if some of Keely's equipment may have survived to the extent that it was employed or tested by Astor on his strange craft.

有一个可疑的事件可能会使这些神秘领域的观点有一定的分量。1910年，据报道，阿斯特在哈莱姆河停靠了一艘“神秘飞船”。15年前，阿斯特曾想为基利提供数百万美元的资金。一家报纸称，这艘飞船“似乎是一艘带有实用船只的飞艇”。 由于记者们被拒之门外，似乎没有其他关于这一主题的信息浮出水面，我们只能怀疑Keely的一些设备是否存活到Astor在其奇怪的飞船上使用或测试的程度。

The whereabouts of only two of Keely's original devices are known today, which is but a mere fraction, considering the 20 large crates that went to Kinraide's cave at Jamaica Plain, and the devices that were in storage in Philadelphia. The Franklin Institute had one, which was sold in the 1970s, and currently there is a device on display in the American Precision Museum in Vermont. It is labeled "Keely's Etheric Force Main Stator." This engine was donated around 1984 to the museum. The device is quite useless for research purposes, as it lacks certain parts and is incomplete.

现在只知道Keely的两个原始装置的下落，考虑到运往牙买加平原Kinraide洞穴的20个大板条箱和存放在费城的装置，这只是一小部分。富兰克林研究所有一台，于20世纪70年代出售，目前有一台设备在佛蒙特州的美国精密博物馆展出。它被标记为“Keely的以太力主定子”。这台发动机于1984年左右捐赠给博物馆。该设备对于研究目的来说毫无用处，因为它缺少某些部件并且不完整。

It is also a mystery that of all people in the world, Moore acted as the spokesperson for Kinraide. For it was he who had at one time battled over his father's will with his mother. He had always been antagonistic towards Keely, and had a substantial role in what has become known as Keely's exposure.

在世界上所有人中，摩尔是金莱德的代言人，这也是一个谜。因为有一段时间，正是他与母亲为父亲的遗嘱而斗争。他一直对基利持敌对态度，并在基利的曝光中发挥了重要作用。
